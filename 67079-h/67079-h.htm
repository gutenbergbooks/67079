<h3>
CHAPTER ONE
</h3>

<p>
A dark green Rolls-Royce limousine slid round the
corner of Sydney Place and, proceeding a few hundred
yards along the Fulham Road, drew up in front of
St. Christopher's Hospital.  It had scarcely stopped
before the door opened and its solitary occupant&mdash;a
tall, well-dressed man of about fifty&mdash;stepped out on
to the pavement.
</p>

<p>
"You can wait here, Simmons," he said, addressing
the chauffeur.  "I shan't be more than a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
The porter on duty, who was talking to a friend in
the hall, touched his cap respectfully as the newcomer
hurried past him in the direction of the main staircase.
</p>

<p>
"See that bloke, Fred?" he whispered, jerking his
thumb after the retreating figure.  "That's Sir George
Onslow, that is.  Some pore beggar's for it, you can
take my word."
</p>

<p>
"Well, thank Gawd 'e ain't a-goin' to 'ack me
about," returned the other.  "Pack o' butchers, all the
lot of 'em, if they gets 'alf a chance."
</p>

<p>
Unconscious of having been the cause of this somewhat
drastic criticism of his profession, the famous
surgeon mounted rapidly to the second landing, where
a long, bare, distempered corridor stretched away in
either direction.  Choosing the one on the left, he
came to a halt in front of a white door, on which the
two words "House Surgeon" were neatly painted in
black letters, and, without troubling to knock, turned
the handle and walked in.
</p>

<p>
A broad-shouldered, cheerful-looking young man,
who was sitting at the table reading a medical book,
glanced up carelessly at his entrance.  On seeing who
the visitor was his expression changed, and with a
certain air of surprise he rose quickly to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Sir George," he exclaimed.  "We weren't
expecting you this morning."
</p>

<p>
The elder man stepped forward and offered his
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry to interrupt your studies, Gray," he said,
smiling.  "This isn't an official visit.  I've just looked
in on a little private and personal matter."
</p>

<p>
The young house surgeon pulled forward a tattered
armchair.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm delighted to see you, sir," he said
heartily.  "Won't you take a pew?"
</p>

<p>
Sir George sat down, and, leaning forward, helped
himself to a cigarette from the box which his
companion offered him.
</p>

<p>
"You were telling me about your plans a week or
two ago," he said.  "Have you come to any decision
yet?"
</p>

<p>
Gray, who was standing with his back to the
fireplace, nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered.  "I've made up my mind to
send in my resignation as soon as the secretary comes
back.  I can't help feeling that I'm wasting my time
here.  I have always meant to go in for research
work, and if I'm to do any good at it it's quite time I
started."  He laughed a little awkwardly.  "I hope
it doesn't sound conceited talking like this, sir, but I
really believe I've got a turn in that direction."
</p>

<p>
Sir George looked up at him with a friendly,
half-quizzical twinkle in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"You needn't apologize, my boy," he said gravely.
"I don't think any one would accuse you of having a
swelled head."  He paused.  "If it doesn't sound an
impertinent question, may I ask how you are situated
with regard to money matters?"
</p>

<p>
"I can manage all right," replied the other.  "I've
got a small private income of about three hundred a
year.  I should have to give up the car, of course, but
one can't expect luxuries if one goes in for laboratory
work."
</p>

<p>
Sir George nodded his head approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"That's the proper frame of mind, anyhow," he
observed.  "There's no half-and-half business about
science.  It's a great game if you're prepared to give
up everything else to it, but if you want money and
comfort and reputation&mdash;well, you'd better copy my
example and spend your time cutting out the entrails
of over-fed millionaires."  He flicked the ash off his
cigarette, and, sinking back again in the chair, crossed
his legs.  "All the same," he added, "it just happens
that I might be able to put something in your way
which would make it possible for you to keep the car
and hunt bugs at the same time."
</p>

<p>
Gray's boyish face lit up with sudden interest.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, sir!" he exclaimed.  "That sounds promising!"
</p>

<p>
"How would you like to go and live with old Carter
as a sort of residential assistant?"
</p>

<p>
"Carter?" Gray repeated the name almost reverently.
"Do you mean Professor Carter?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do.  You don't suppose I'm referring
to the man who makes the liver pills?"
</p>

<p>
"You can bet I should like it all right," was the
eager reply.  "Why, it's a chance for which any chap
in my position would sell his soul."
</p>

<p>
The surgeon smiled again at his young companion's
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think it might be arranged on less dramatic
terms than that.  As a matter of fact, I was talking to
the old boy last night.  He doesn't often show up in
public nowadays, but he happened to come along to a
special meeting of the Board of Health, and he and I
had a long yarn together.  Amongst other things he
asked me if I knew a young fellow who'd make a suitable
assistant.  He wants someone to live in the house,
and he told me that if he could find the right man he
was prepared to pay a salary of four hundred a year.
That, of course, would be in addition to living expenses."
</p>

<p>
"Four hundred a year!" echoed Gray in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he can afford it well enough.  He's rolling in
money, and he never spends a bob on anything except
his work."
</p>

<p>
"Why, he can take his pick amongst the best-trained
men in England," declared Gray.  "They'd simply
fall over themselves to get in with Carter, whether
there's a salary attached to it or not."
</p>

<p>
"That may be the case," assented Sir George drily,
"but, as it happens, very few of them possess the
particular qualification on which the Professor insists.
You see, he wants someone who's an expert boxer as
well as being a fully qualified scientist."
</p>

<p>
Gray stared at his visitor in utter bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"Sounds a bit comic, doesn't it?" pursued the latter
tranquilly.  "The fact is the old gentleman's suffering
from nerves.  About nine weeks ago his house on
Campden Hill was broken into by burglars, and ever
since then he seems to have been living in a mortal
funk that the same thing would happen again."
</p>

<p>
"But hasn't he any one in the place besides himself?"
demanded Gray.
</p>

<p>
"Only a couple of women who cook for him and
look after the house.  He had an old servant for
about forty years, but I think he's pensioned him
off.  Of course, it really isn't very safe as things are.
Carter must be over eighty, and the Red Lodge is a
devilish lonely place, shut in behind a high wall
amongst a lot of trees.  I don't wonder he feels a bit
jumpy."
</p>

<p>
"But is he quite serious about wanting an assistant?"
demanded Gray.  "At present it sounds as if he were
in more need of a bull-dog."
</p>

<p>
Sir George laughed.  "It's a genuine enough offer,"
he said.  "He confided to me that he'd just undertaken
some very important researches, and that it was
absolutely necessary he should have a first-class man to
help him.  I thought of you at once.  I said all the
complimentary things I could about your work, and I
added, as a sort of little extra inducement, that you'd
won the inter-hospital heavyweight boxing competition
for two years in succession."
</p>

<p>
Gray coloured modestly.  "It was awfully good of
you, Sir George," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," was the answer.  "In my opinion he'll
be very lucky if he gets you.  I told him I'd look you
up and see how you felt about it, and that if you liked
the idea I'd let him know some time to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be ready to go directly I can get away from
the hospital," declared Gray.
</p>

<p>
Sir George Onslow threw away the stump of his
cigarette and rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think there will be any difficulty about that.
I'll speak to the chairman personally, and if Carter
wants you at once we can easily find someone to carry
on until the secretary comes back," He glanced at his
watch.  "I must be running along now.  I've got to
be at the nursing home by twelve-thirty."
</p>

<p>
After expressing his gratitude once more, Gray
accompanied his visitor down to the hall, where he
remained standing on the steps until the car drove
away.  He was just turning back toward the
staircase when the porter, who was engaged with the
telephone, thrust his head out of the box.
</p>

<p>
"Gen'leman wants to speak to you, sir&mdash;a Mister
Ashton."
</p>

<p>
Gray walked forward and picked up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" he observed encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" came the answer.  "That you, Colin?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course it's me."
</p>

<p>
"Mark speaking&mdash;Mark Ashton.  Are you engaged
for lunch?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if I can get any one else to pay for it," was
the candid reply.
</p>

<p>
"Well, how would you like to come along and feed
with me at the Savoy Grill?"
</p>

<p>
"I've no particular objection.  What's the matter?
Have you come into money?"
</p>

<p>
There was a chuckle at the other end of the wire.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing like that.  Just a sudden thirst for your
society."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be gratified," said Gray.  "What time
shall I show up?"
</p>

<p>
"One o'clock.  Suit you all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Excellently."
</p>

<p>
"That'll do, then.  If you get there first order
yourself a cocktail."
</p>

<p>
The speaker rang off, and, replacing the receiver,
Gray glanced at his watch.
</p>

<p>
It was a few minutes past twelve, and, being the
day on which he was off duty, there was nothing to
prevent him leaving the hospital as soon as he pleased.
The prospect of a two-mile walk before lunch distinctly
appealed to him, so, remounting the stairs to his
small bedroom at the top of the building, he proceeded
to change out of his white surgeon's kit into something
a little more in harmony with the best traditions of a
fashionable restaurant.
</p>

<p>
At exactly five minutes to one he passed through
the revolving glass door of the Savoy and entered the
already crowded lounge.  Before he had time to glance
round, a man, who had been sitting in the farther
corner, rose to his feet and came forward to meet him.
</p>

<p>
No one, not even a newspaper reporter, would have
called Mark Ashton handsome.  In spite of his
roughly cut features, his untidy hair, his badly fitting
frock coat, and his large gold-rimmed spectacles there
was, however, such a genuine and friendly air about
his whole appearance that anybody except a fool would
have been attracted by him at once.  Somehow or
other he reminded one of a large, shaggy,
good-tempered dog.
</p>

<p>
He came up to Gray and shook him heartily by the
hand.
</p>

<p>
"This is splendid, Colin," he said.  "I'm awfully
glad you were able to manage it."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," returned his guest.  "It would have
broken my heart to refuse an invitation like this."
</p>

<p>
Mark grinned broadly, and, thrusting his arm
through his companion's, piloted him across the lounge
in the direction of the grill-room door.
</p>

<p>
"I've ordered a table," he announced, "so unless
you'd rather wait a bit we may as well have lunch
right away."
</p>

<p>
"That will suit me," said Colin cheerfully.  "I
breakfasted at eight, and I've just walked up from the
hospital."
</p>

<p>
Following an obsequious gentleman, who apparently
recognized Mark, they threaded their way through the
room and took their places at a small table in the
opposite corner, which looked out into the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
Mark picked up the menu and studied it with some
care.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say about oysters to start with?" he
suggested.  "A dozen oysters each and a bottle of
Chablis?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a good idea," admitted Colin.  "Especially
the Chablis."
</p>

<p>
"We can discuss what we'll have afterward while
we're eating them," continued his host.  He gave the
order, and, as the waiter departed, he sat back in his
chair and took a genial survey of the restaurant.
</p>

<p>
"What is the precise meaning of this debauch?"
inquired Colin.  "Is it your birthday or have you been
backing the winner of the Cesarewitch?"
</p>

<p>
The other laughed good-naturedly.  "I told you
over the telephone.  It's just a case of a hard-working
East End doctor snatching a brief interval from his
practice to enjoy the society of his most brilliant and
distinguished pupil."  He paused.  "As a matter of
fact," he added, "the whole thing was Mary's notion.
I wanted to have a talk with you, and she suggested
that I should take a couple of hours off and invite you
to lunch."
</p>

<p>
"Mary's a great woman," said Colin with feeling.
"Why didn't you bring her along with you?"
</p>

<p>
"She's stopped behind to console the patients,
shall have scores of 'em hanging round the surgery
when I get back."  He sighed heavily.
</p>

<p>
"Well, cheer up," said Colin.  "By the time we've
finished lunch they'll probably be dead."  He helped
himself to a roll, and, breaking off a bit of the crust,
proceeded to nibble it thoughtfully.  "What did you
want to see me about?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
Mark paused, while two waiters, who had suddenly
appeared with the oysters and the Chablis, hovered
round the table, intent on their ministrations.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing much," he replied eventually.  "I was
wondering if by any chance you could find me a girl."
</p>

<p>
"Find you a girl?" echoed Colin.  "Why, you old
Mormon, you've got Mary already."
</p>

<p>
"That's just the trouble," was the depressed answer.
"Mary has to go off to Lincoln for a month to nurse
her mother.  After next Wednesday I shall be a
grass widower."
</p>

<p>
Colin looked at him with genuine sympathy.  "My
poor lad!" he exclaimed.  "This is indeed a blow!"
</p>

<p>
"It's worse than that," observed his companion.
"It's&mdash;it's a damned knock-out.  She's never been
away from me for more than a day, not since we went
down to Shadwell.  Heaven only knows how I shall
get on without her.  She answers the letters, keeps the
accounts, pays the bills, mixes the medicines&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In fact," broke in Colin, "to put it plainly, she's a
darn sight more important to the business than you
are."  He speared a recalcitrant oyster and sprinkled
it with red pepper.  "I wonder you let her go,"
he added mischievously.  "Why don't you take up
the strong, silent husband stunt and refuse to allow
it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't do that," objected Mark.  "You see,
the old lady really is very seedy.  She's going to have
an operation in about a month's time, and meanwhile
she's got to keep to her bed.  She's simply set her
heart on having Mary to come and look after her, and
I couldn't be such an utterly selfish pig as to go and
put any difficulties in the way."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't suppose you could," admitted Colin.
"That sort of thing requires a lot of practice."
</p>

<p>
"We've talked it over," continued Mark, "and we've
decided that the best plan would be to try and find
some nice, sensible girl who'd come in for the day and
make herself generally useful.  Of course, it isn't
exactly easy to get hold of the right person.  I want a
really capable, honest, pleasant girl, who can type and
keep accounts, and who'll take a kind of personal
interest in the whole show."
</p>

<p>
"You don't want much," observed Colin drily.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm prepared to pay for it, and if she turned
out to be any use I'd keep her on permanently.  I've
been meaning to do something of the sort for the last
six months.  Mary's been working far too hard, and
I'm making such a sinful amount of money I can quite
well afford a little extra help."  He pushed away his
empty oyster shells and beckoned to the waiter.
"We'd better order some more grub, eh?  Can you
manage a cold grouse?"
</p>

<p>
"With ease," said Colin.
</p>

<p>
He remained silent until the man had departed, and
then, picking up the Chablis, refilled his glass.
</p>

<p>
"But where do I come in?" he inquired.  "You're
not expecting me to produce angels out of my
waistcoat pocket?"
</p>

<p>
"We thought you might be able to recommend
somebody.  Mary said that a young, dashing,
good-looking fellow like you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She was pulling your leg," protested Colin.  "She
knows perfectly well that I'm terrified of girls."
</p>

<p>
"How about the hospital?  Haven't you a pretty,
intelligent nurse who'd like a nice Christian home?"
</p>

<p>
"I've never noticed her if we have."  He paused
as the recollection of his conversation with Sir George
Onslow suddenly flashed into his mind.  "By Jove!"
he added.  "That reminds me.  I haven't told you
my great news yet.  I'm chucking the hospital and
going as bottle-washer to old Carter."
</p>

<p>
His companion stared at him half incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Is this a fact?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's practically settled.  I've had nothing to
do with it really; Onslow's worked the whole thing
for me.  I'd just finished talking to him when you rang
up."
</p>

<p>
In a few words he described his interview with Sir
George and the curious information which the latter
had given him with regard to the professor's requirements.
</p>

<p>
"I can't say if I shall fit the bill," he added, laughing,
"but if the old boy takes a fancy to me I don't
care how many damned burglars he has.  I'd tackle
half a dozen a night for the sake of being his
assistant."
</p>

<p>
"It's a wonderful chance," admitted Mark thoughtfully.
"Carter may be a little queer, but there's no
doubt that he's the greatest man at his game in the
world."  He looked across rather wistfully into the
strong, smiling face opposite him.  "You're a fortunate
young devil, Colin," he added.  "Nature's presented
you with practically everything a man can want&mdash;brains,
good looks, and the strength of a cart-horse&mdash;and
now I'm hanged if you're not going to be lucky as
well.  I'd have given my head for an opening like
this when I was your age.  Just fancy being able to
devote one's life to science instead of wasting it in the
futile way I've done."
</p>

<p>
"You're talking through your hat," protested Colin
indignantly. "If you chose you could be sitting in
an armchair in Harley Street, but instead of that you
and Mary live down there in Shadwell and sweat your
souls out amongst the poorest of the poor.  Don't
you call that good work?"
</p>

<p>
"Splendid," agreed Mark.  "Stuffing 'em up with
coloured water and ginger pills and making fifteen
hundred a year out of the poor blighters for doing
it."  He smiled with a cheerful good nature that was
rather out of keeping with his words.  "I'm not
envious, Colin.  I'm only too delighted to know that
you've found the right opening.  Two or three years'
experience with Carter will be simply invaluable to
you.  It will put you in the very front rank of
investigators, and what's more, it will give you the
opportunity of carrying on his work after he's dead.  You'll
be a great man before you've finished.  When I'm an
old buffer of eighty I shall probably go around
bragging that the famous Sir Colin Gray was once my
junior house surgeon at Bart's."
</p>

<p>
"Always supposing," added the future celebrity,
"that I'm not knocked on the head by a burglar."  He
rolled up a bread pill and eyed his host meditatively.
"It's a rummy affair, the whole business," he continued.
"I wonder if there's anything behind it?  D'you think
Carter's just got the wind up, or d'you think he's one
of those old juggins who keeps thousands of pounds
buried in the back cellar?"
</p>

<p>
Mark shrugged his shoulders.  "Goodness knows,"
he replied.  "Anyhow, he ought to be safe enough
with you.  If I were a self-respecting burglar with a
proper regard for my appearance I should give the
Red Lodge a devilish wide berth.  I know that right
upper-cut of yours; I've had some of it."
</p>

<p>
The appearance of the grouse at this point created
a temporary diversion, and it was not until lunch was
finished, and the two of them were sitting over their
coffee and cigars, that Mark returned to his original
subject.
</p>

<p>
"You won't forget, will you," he said, "if you run
across a likely damsel.  I shall be absolutely in the
soup unless I get hold of somebody the next day or
two."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do my best for you," Colin assured him.  "I'll
have a general inspection of all the nurses at the
hospital to-morrow morning, and if there's a stray
angel amongst them I'll send her along.  I shouldn't
bank on it though, not from what I remember of them."
</p>

<p>
Mark pulled out his note case and beckoned to the
waiter.
</p>

<p>
"I must be off," he observed resentfully.  "Which
way are you going&mdash;back to the hospital?"
</p>

<p>
Colin shook his head.  "This is my day out.  I shall
roll along to the garage and spend a nice messy afternoon
tinkering at the car.  There are several odd jobs
that want doing, and I should like to get them cleared
off before I start chasing burglars."
</p>

<p>
Mark paid the bill, and, leaving the restaurant, the
two friends walked together as far as Charing Cross
Underground, where they came to a halt on the bridge
inside the barrier.
</p>

<p>
"Well, thanks for an excellent lunch," said Colin,
shaking his host's hand.  "Remember that if you ever
want my advice it's always available on the same
terms."
</p>

<p>
Mark grinned.  "You must come down and thank
Mary," he said.  "It was she who suggested the
Savoy.  If it had been left to me I should probably
have taken you to Lockhart's."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke an East End train clanked noisily out
of the opposite tunnel, and with a hurried good-bye he
darted away toward the steps and disappeared from
view.
</p>

<p>
About twenty minutes later, with the stump of a
cigar in his mouth, and feeling remarkably at peace
with the world, Colin emerged from Sloane Street
Station and strolled across the pavement in the
direction of the barracks.
</p>

<p>
He kept his car in a small garage at the bottom of
Church Street, a place which, in addition to being
cheap and within easy reach of the hospital, also
possessed the unusual distinction of having an honest
proprietor.  It was about three-quarters of a mile
from the Square, but as he was in no hurry, and the
weather was extraordinarily genial for an afternoon
in late November, he dismissed his first intention of
taking a motor bus and started off at a leisurely pace
along the King's Road.
</p>

<p>
He had got as far as the corner of Radnor Street
when his progress was suddenly arrested by a muffled
outbreak of shouts and oaths.  The next moment the
door of a small public house opposite burst violently
open, and from its gas-lit interior a tangled cluster of
struggling men swayed out into the main thoroughfare.
One of them was evidently a policeman, for his blue
helmet was clearly visible in the centre of the melee.
</p>

<p>
For a second or two the whole mass reeled backward
and forward, then a stick swung up into the
air, and, coming down with crashing force on the back
of the constable's head, stretched him out an inert
mass in the gutter.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWO
</h3>

<p>
However underpaid it may be, the training of a
house surgeon at a London hospital induces a certain
readiness of action.  Before any of the other passers-by
had ceased to gape helplessly at this unusual
spectacle Colin was halfway across the street.
</p>

<p>
Quick as he was, however, the situation had already
developed.  A big, burly man, clutching another by
the collar, had staggered back against the wall of the
pub, where, with his disengaged arm, he was endeavouring
to defend himself as best he could against a
rain of blows and kicks.
</p>

<p>
Striking out mercilessly right and left, Colin forced
his way through the gang.  He was only just in time,
for exactly as he arrived a vicious kick in the ribs sent
the big stranger sprawling to the pavement, his fingers
still gripping the collar of his half-throttled prisoner.
</p>

<p>
The man who had laid him out&mdash;a truculent-looking
scoundrel in a blue suit&mdash;was stepping in to complete
his work when a smashing swing from Colin caught
him full in the mouth.  Reeling back from the blow,
he collided violently with one of his friends, and for
a second the whole attacking party were thrown into
confusion.
</p>

<p>
Before they could recover the shrill note of a police
whistle rang out close behind them.  They all spun
round instinctively, and through a gap in their ranks
Colin caught sight of the slim figure of a girl stooping
over the prostrate body of the constable.  It was
only a brief glimpse, for the next moment one of the
ruffians sprang backward and lashed out at her with
his belt.  Dropping the whistle, she sank forward on
to her knees, and with a wild, clattering rush the entire
gang took to their heels.
</p>

<p>
In two strides Colin was at the girl's side.  He was
not easily upset, but the sight of that cowardly blow
had filled him with such a sudden wave of fury that
he found it difficult to control his voice as he bent
down over the crouching figure.
</p>

<p>
"Are you much hurt?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She raised her head, and a pair of beautiful but
rather bewildered blue eyes looked up into his.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said.  "I don't think I am.  Is it all
over?"
</p>

<p>
In spite of his anger Colin began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he added, "it's all over.  They've bolted like
a lot of rabbits, thanks to you."
</p>

<p>
He took her by the arm, and a trifle unsteadily,
she scrambled to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"How do you feel?" he asked with some anxiety.
"I was horribly afraid he'd hit you on the head."
</p>

<p>
"So he did," was the answer, "but luckily for me
I've got a good deal of protection."
</p>

<p>
She lifted off the small velvet hat that she was
wearing and rather tenderly patted the thick coils
of dark red hair which gleamed like copper in the
fading November sunlight.  "The queer thing is," she
added, "that it hasn't even given me a headache."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I'd known you were all right," said Colin
ruefully.  "I'd have gone after the brute and wrung
his neck."
</p>

<p>
"You didn't do so badly as it was, mister," observed
a voice at his elbow, and, turning round sharply,
he found himself face to face with the burly stranger,
whom he had last seen scuffling on the pavement.
Except for a slight trickle of blood from the corner
of his mouth the latter looked none the worse for his
adventures.
</p>

<p>
"I owe something both to you and to this young
lady," he continued.  "If you hadn't come along just
when you did I'd probably have got my head kicked in."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't thank me," protested Colin.  "There's
nothing I enjoy better than a good scrap."
</p>

<p>
He glanced round the late field of battle with a
certain amount of amused curiosity.  Three fresh and
energetic-looking policemen had already appeared.
One of them was grasping the arm of the now handcuffed
prisoner, a second knelt beside the body of his
injured comrade, while the third, with that scant
ceremony which distinguishes the Metropolitan force, was
thrusting back a rapidly increasing throng of
interested spectators.
</p>

<p>
"What's it all about?" asked Colin.
</p>

<p>
Rummaging in his waistcoat pocket, the big man
produced a dilapidated card.
</p>

<p>
"You'll see my name there," he said.  "Inspector
Marsden of the C.I.D."  He jerked his head in the
direction of the captive&mdash;a short, sandy-haired
individual with a face like a rather disagreeable ferret.
"You've helped us to get hold of a gentleman we've
been wanting badly at the Yard for the last two
months.  That's 'Ginger Dick,' the leader of the
toughest race-course gang in England."
</p>

<p>
"He must be fairly popular with his friends,"
observed Colin.  "At least, they seemed quite anxious
not to lose his society."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector smiled grimly.  "You don't know
'em, sir.  You can take it from me that all they're
worrying about is whether he's going to split on 'em.
There isn't a man in that crowd who wouldn't sell
his own mother."  He moved over to the second
constable, who was still busy with his unconscious mate.
"What's the damage?" he asked.  "Anything serious?"
</p>

<p>
Colin stepped across after him.  "You'd better let
me have a look," he said.  "I'm a doctor."
</p>

<p>
The two men at once made way, and, kneeling down
in the gutter, he rapidly examined his patient's
condition.
</p>

<p>
"You must get him to hospital as quick as you
can," he said, looking up at the Inspector.  "He's
had a pretty bad crack on the head, and the sooner
he's under treatment the better."  He rose to his feet
and brushed off the dust from his trousers.  "Take
him along to St. Christopher's," he added.  "Tell
them that Doctor Gray sent you, and that it's a case
which requires immediate attention."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector nodded, and, having despatched one
of his assistants to fetch an ambulance, turned back
and addressed himself to the girl.
</p>

<p>
"You'll pardon me for not having thanked you
before, miss," he said.  "I never saw anything pluckier
in my life than the way you chipped in and blew that
whistle.  There's not one young lady in a thousand
who'd have had the nerve to do it."
</p>

<p>
The recipient of his praises coloured delicately.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't mind," he continued, "I'll make a note
of your name and address.  We might be glad of your
evidence, and I know the commissioner would like to
write you a little letter to send you his official thanks."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he mustn't trouble to do that," objected the
girl hastily.  "I'm sure he's frightfully busy, and, after
all, it's quite easy just to blow a whistle."
</p>

<p>
Colin laughed.  "You can't get out of it," he said.
"Still, if you'll tell the Inspector your name and where
you live I don't suppose he'll bother you to give
evidence unless it's absolutely necessary."
</p>

<p>
"You can count on that, miss," remarked the other
reassuringly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I live just round the corner at No. 46 Jubilee
Place," said the girl, "and my name's Seymour&mdash;Miss
Nancy Seymour."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector committed this information to an
official-looking pocketbook, and then held out his
hand to Colin.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't forget that you've saved my life, doctor,"
he said.  "I hope that next time you're up in our
direction you'll look in and pay us a visit."  He paused.
"And remember," he added, "that if there's ever any
little way in which we can be of use to you, you've only
got to let us know.  We like to pay our debts at the
Yard when we get the opportunity."
</p>

<p>
"I shall remember," said Colin, smiling.  "It might
come in handy one of these days."
</p>

<p>
He stepped forward as a movement amongst the
onlookers heralded the approach of the ambulance,
and, after assisting to lift the injured constable inside,
came back to where the girl was standing.
</p>

<p>
"Can I see you as far as your house?" he asked.
"I don't suppose any of those blackguards are still
hanging about, but there's no point in running risks."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said simply.  "I should be very
grateful if you would."
</p>

<p>
Under a fire of curious glances they pushed their
way through the crowd and started off along the
pavement in the direction of Jubilee Place.
</p>

<p>
Colin was the first to break the silence.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you spring from?" he asked.  "I never
saw you until you blew the whistle."
</p>

<p>
"I had just come out to buy a stamp," replied his
companion.  "I was walking peacefully along to King's
Road when I suddenly found myself right in the
middle of it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've got some pluck," said Colin admiringly.
"That Inspector was quite right in what he
said.  Most girls would have given a shriek and
flopped down in the gutter."
</p>

<p>
She coloured again in the same attractive fashion
as before.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't a question of pluck," she objected.  "I
acted entirely from impulse.  If I had had time to
think I should probably have done what you say."  She
stopped short with a little gesture of annoyance.
"Oh dear, how stupid I am!  I've quite forgotten to
buy the stamp after all."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter," said Colin.  "I've got one in
my pocket I can let you have."
</p>

<p>
They turned up a narrow street with some white
buildings on one side of it, and at the door of the
second house the girl halted.
</p>

<p>
"This is where I live," she said.  "It was awfully
kind of you to walk back with me."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," said Colin.  "I'm very fond of a little
gentle exercise."  He pulled out a note-case and began
to search through its various compartments.  "If you'll
wait half a minute," he added, "I'll see if I can find
you that stamp."
</p>

<p>
She stood watching him with a certain look of
indecision in her face.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know if you'd care to come in," she said
rather hesitatingly.  "I have only got a small studio,
but I can at least offer you a cup of tea."
</p>

<p>
Colin unearthed the stamp and presented it to her
in triumph.
</p>

<p>
"If you're quite certain I shan't be a nuisance," he
said, "I should like it immensely.  Fighting in the
street always gives me a thirst."
</p>

<p>
Miss Nancy Seymour's blue eyes twinkled merrily,
and, inserting a Yale key into the lock, she led the way
up a small winding staircase to a door on the first
landing.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't mind if it's not very tidy," she
remarked apologetically.  "I have been typing all the
morning, and I've not had time to put things straight."
</p>

<p>
She opened the door, and, following her inside,
Colin found himself in an oddly shaped but rather
attractive apartment, the principal feature of which
was a big glass skylight, shaped like a coach-house
roof.
</p>

<p>
The furniture was scanty, consisting chiefly of a low,
comfortable-looking couch, a couple of old Windsor
armchairs, and a stout deal table which at some
remote period had evidently been stained brown.  On the
latter stood a typewriter flanked by a litter of loose
sheets and several piles of badly written manuscript.
</p>

<p>
The farther corner of the room was curtained off,
as though to serve the purpose of a kitchen or bedroom.
</p>

<p>
With a wave of her hand Nancy indicated the couch.
"Try my patent sofa," she said hospitably.  "I'll tidy
up while the kettle's boiling."
</p>

<p>
"Don't do it for me," protested Colin.  "I like to
see a room a little topsy-turvy.  You can't think how
refreshing it seems after the suffocating neatness of a
hospital."
</p>

<p>
"I'll put away these horrible manuscripts at all
events," returned his hostess.  "I've been working at
them ever since nine o'clock.  The mere sight of them
makes me feel ill."
</p>

<p>
"What are they?" inquired Colin.
</p>

<p>
She made as near an approach to a grimace as
nature would allow.
</p>

<p>
"Stories.  And such bad ones!  I think that all the
worst authors in the world must live in Chelsea."
</p>

<p>
"It was rather unkind to type them out," observed
Colin.  "Somebody will probably have to read them
now."
</p>

<p>
Nancy laughed.  "Unfortunately," she said, "it
happens to be my profession."
</p>

<p>
She covered up the typewriter and collected all the
papers into an indiscriminate bundle.
</p>

<p>
"I sha'n't be long," she added, moving away toward
the curtain.  "Make yourself comfortable, and please
smoke if you want to."
</p>

<p>
Accepting both these invitations, Colin lighted a
cigarette and took up a restful position on the couch.
He felt curiously at home, considering the novelty of
his surroundings, but the whole affair had been so
unusual that somehow or other this impromptu tea
party seemed to constitute a natural and appropriate
climax.
</p>

<p>
That it would also turn out to be an extremely
entertaining one he had no manner of doubt.  Whoever
Miss Nancy Seymour might be, she was certainly the
most attractive girl he had ever met in his life.  Her
looks alone were sufficient to arouse anybody's
enthusiasm.  With her vividly coloured hair and almost
forget-me-not blue eyes she possessed that sort of
inspiriting beauty which Rossetti in his healthier and
happier moments would have revelled in painting.
</p>

<p>
But, delightful as Colin found her appearance, there
was something still more fascinating to him in the
unaffected simplicity and friendliness of her manner.
What he had said to Mark about his knowledge of
women was perfectly true.  As a medical student he
had worked exceptionally hard, and this fact,
combined with his devotion to football and boxing, had
left him little time to cultivate any of those
semi-amorous friendships which seem to be the principal
hobby of so many budding physicians.  It was, in fact,
the first time that he had ever been perfectly at ease
in a girl's society, and the sensation was so pleasing
that he felt no objection to its indefinite extension.
</p>

<p>
He could hear Nancy moving about behind the
curtain, the pop of a gas ring and the chink of cups
giving some clue to the nature of her activities.  Six
or seven minutes must have elapsed, however, before
she made her reappearance, this time carrying a tray
with all the necessary equipment for tea.  She had
discarded her hat and coat, and in her simple indoor
costume Colin thought that she looked prettier than
ever.
</p>

<p>
"Don't get up," she said, as he started to rise to
his feet.  "I'll bring over that other little table and
then we can help ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Suiting the action to the word, she deposited the
tray on the end of the sofa, and pulled up a sort of
rickety three-legged stool which looked like the final
effort of some disillusioned amateur carpenter.
</p>

<p>
"It's all rather primitive," she continued, "but you
must pretend not to notice.  You see, I've had to
furnish the place myself, and I've never yet had enough
money to do it properly."
</p>

<p>
Colin looked round with a contented eye.  "I don't
see what more you want," he observed, "not unless
you're naturally luxurious."
</p>

<p>
"I expect that must be it," she replied, pouring out
the tea.  "Anyhow, I know that directly I can afford
it I mean to buy some new curtains and also a nice
thick velvety carpet from Harrod's."  She smiled.
"That won't be for some time though&mdash;not unless
there's a boom in bad stories."
</p>

<p>
"If it isn't an impertinent question," said Colin,
"how long have you been in Chelsea?"
</p>

<p>
"About eighteen months," she answered, handing
him his cup.  "I had always lived in the country
before then, but there were reasons why I had to start
work of some sort, and typing was the only useful
thing I happened to know.  Somebody told me that
Chelsea was full of authors, so I came here, and here
I've been ever since."
</p>

<p>
Colin helped himself to a sugared biscuit.  "I hope
you charge them a lot," he said, "and I hope they pay
regularly."
</p>

<p>
"It might be worse," she replied.  "As it happens,
I've got enough money of my own to pay the rent of
the studio, and what I make out of my typing just
keeps me going in clothes and food and cigarettes."  She
paused to refill the teapot.  "It's just the feeling
that I'm wasting my time so," she continued, "that
annoys me.  If I were working at something really
useful I should be quite happy, but this stuff"&mdash;she
made a distasteful gesture toward the table&mdash;"well, I
can't think how anybody can possibly write it, let alone
read it."
</p>

<p>
Colin suddenly slapped his leg with a bang which
made the china rattle.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" he exclaimed.  "Why, of course, you're
the very girl!"
</p>

<p>
He laid down his cup and gazed at her in a kind of
triumphant satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Nancy returned his inspection with a perplexed
smile.  "I daresay I am," she admitted.  "It's rather
hard to tell at present, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Colin laughed.  "I'm not mad," he explained.  "If
you meant what you said just now, if you're really
looking out for something that's worth doing, I can
put you on to a job straight away."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence.
</p>

<p>
"It's very nice of you," said Nancy.  "The only
question is that I should probably be quite unqualified
for it."
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary," retorted Colin, "you're the exact
person that I've been commissioned to find."
</p>

<p>
"It must be a queer sort of job then," remarked
Nancy, still smiling.  "All you know about me at
present is that I can type, make tea, and blow a police
whistle."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there you are," observed her guest.  "It's
just that all-round sort of ability that Mark wants."
</p>

<p>
He sat back against the wall, and, without any
further delay, proceeded to enter into a full description
of the distressing problem which overhung the
Shadwell ménage.
</p>

<p>
"If you'll chip in and fill the gap," he continued,
"you'll be doing a real Christian act.  Mark jeers at
his own work, but, as a matter of cold fact, he and
Mary have buried themselves down in that beastly
slum out of sheer good nature.  They're the sort of
people you don't meet twice in a lifetime.  Mark's a
brick, and Mary's just the sweetest and most unselfish
woman that ever trod this earth."
</p>

<p>
"They sound perfect dears," said Nancy.  "I should
love to know them whether I get the job or not."
</p>

<p>
"Get the job!" repeated Colin.  "Why, good Lord,
they'll simply be all over you as soon as you show
yourself."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's blue eyes gleamed merrily.  "You seem to
forget, Doctor Gray," she said, "everybody isn't quite
so rapid and trustful as you are.  They might, for
instance, like to know something about me first."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can tell 'em," replied Colin.  "You
haven't been in prison, have you, or anything of
that sort?  Not that Mark would mind a bit if you
had."
</p>

<p>
"What a nice, obliging man!" was the answer.  "No,
I haven't been in prison, and I don't think I've ever
done anything to deserve it.  All the same, if any one
offered me an engagement they would have to take me
absolutely on trust.  You see, I have never earned a
salary before, so I've got no testimonials."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you have," objected Colin.  "You've got
mine and the policeman's.  That ought to be enough
for any reasonable employer."  He glanced at his
watch.  "Look here," he added eagerly, "if you're
doing nothing in particular, why shouldn't we go down
there straight away?  Mark usually takes half an hour
off for tea about four o'clock, so we should just catch
them at the right time."
</p>

<p>
"How does one get to Shadwell?" asked Nancy.
"I don't even know where it is."
</p>

<p>
Colin jumped up briskly.  "I'll drive you down,"
he said.  "I've got a little car in Church Street.  I
was just going along there to do some repairs."
</p>

<p>
Nancy made a movement of protest.  "Oh, but,
please&mdash;&mdash;" she said.  "I don't want to take up all
your afternoon&mdash;not if you're busy."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," observed Colin.  "You shove on
your hat and coat.  I shall have plenty of time to
tinker at the car when we get back."
</p>

<p>
With an air of resigned amusement Nancy rose to
her feet.
</p>

<p>
"I am trusting entirely to you, Doctor Gray," she
said.  "If your friends throw me out ignominiously I
sha'n't be the least surprised."
</p>

<p>
She collected the tea things, and, crossing the room
to the farther corner, disappeared again behind the
curtain.
</p>

<p>
After a surprisingly short interval she returned,
ready dressed for the journey.
</p>

<p>
"You look ripping," said Colin, eyeing her with
frank approval.  "I'm longing to see old Mark's face
when he hears you're his new secretary."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's more than I am," remarked Nancy.
</p>

<p>
She paused for a second or two to make a final
inspection of herself in the looking glass, and then,
following her guest out on to the landing, closed and
locked the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
They descended the staircase and were just emerging
into the street when a big white Daimler swung
into view round the corner of the King's Road.
</p>

<p>
Nancy uttered a little exclamation which sounded
like one of annoyance, but before she could speak the
driver turned in toward the pavement and drew up
alongside of them.  He proved to be a tall, clean-shaven,
middle-aged man, with rather dissipated blue
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, young lady," he said, raising his hat, "where
are you off to?  I was coming along to take you out
for a drive."
</p>

<p>
Nancy acknowledged his greeting without any
apparent enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"It was very kind of you," she replied, "but I am
afraid I can't manage it to-day.  I have promised to
go out to tea with some friends of Doctor Gray's."  She
paused for a moment, and then glanced hesitatingly
from one to the other of them.  "Let me introduce
you," she added.  "Doctor Gray&mdash;Major Fenton."
</p>

<p>
The two men nodded to each other.
</p>

<p>
"It will do you much more good to come for a
spin," persisted the new arrival.  "Besides, I understood
that we more or less fixed it up last Thursday."
</p>

<p>
"Did we?" said Nancy coolly.  "I don't remember
actually mentioning the day."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I understood so anyhow," returned the
other.  He leaned across and opened the door.  "Come
along," he added persuasively.  "I am sure Doctor
Gray will excuse you."
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt he would," said Nancy, "but, as
it happens, I particularly want to meet his friends."  She
held out a small gloved hand, which the other
accepted with obvious reluctance.  "You must really
excuse me, Major Fenton," she continued.  "I can't
possibly manage to come to-day though I am very
much obliged to you for offering to take me."
</p>

<p>
Except for an ugly glint in his blue eyes, the owner
of the car managed to control his emotions.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well," he said, with a rather forced laugh,
"if you're really booked up, of course that settles it.
We must make it another day instead, eh?  How about
to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow would be all right," said Nancy, "as
far as I know at present."
</p>

<p>
"I'll call for you at the same time, then&mdash;say three
o'clock, or perhaps we'd better make it a quarter past."  He
lifted his hat again, and, after bestowing a curt
nod on Colin, leaned over and closed the door of the
car.  The next moment he was moving away rapidly
up the street.
</p>

<p>
Nancy gave a sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you were with me," she said, as they
started off in the opposite direction.  "If I had been
alone I couldn't very well have got out of it."
</p>

<p>
Colin looked at her in surprise.  "Why on earth
should you go if you don't want to?" he asked.  "Is
that truculent warrior your guardian or what?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy shook her head.  "I don't know anything
about him," she answered, "except that he happens to
be an old friend of my father's."  She paused for an
instant as they turned the corner into King's Road.
"You see, I am rather alone in the world," she
continued.  "My father and mother both died when I was
a baby, and as Major Fenton took the trouble to come
and hunt me out about two months ago I didn't like
to seem ungrateful."
</p>

<p>
There was a touch of wistfulness in her voice which
went straight to Colin's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, that's different," he said gently.  "It's
rotten bad luck to be left all by oneself.  Haven't you
any relations or people of that sort?"
</p>

<p>
"None that I ever heard of," was the answer.  "My
father and mother were living in a little village in
Cornwall, and one day they were caught in a storm out
sailing, and they were both drowned.  No one seemed
to know anything about them at all.  A lawyer at
Helston, a very kind man called Mr. Penwarren,
advertised in the papers and made inquiries everywhere.
They all led to nothing, however, and it ended with
my going to live with an old farmer and his wife who
had offered to take care of me.  There was a little
money&mdash;something like nine hundred pounds&mdash;which
Mr. Penwarren had invested for me, and that gave me
the chance of coming to London and setting up as a
typist."  She stopped short, and glanced at Colin
with a sudden trace of embarrassment.  "I don't
know why I am telling you all this," she added.  "I'm
afraid I must be boring you horribly."
</p>

<p>
Colin shook his head.  "I never felt more interested
in my life.  I thought that things like that only
happened in books and plays."
</p>

<p>
"I wish they did," said Nancy.  "I simply hate not
knowing who I am.  It makes one feel like a lost
dog."
</p>

<p>
"But how about our genial friend in the car?"
inquired Colin.  "If he was a pal of your father's he
must surely have been able to give you some information."
</p>

<p>
"That's just what he can't do," said Nancy.  "He
met my father years ago down at Forth Leven, where
they used to go out fishing together.  He went abroad
with his regiment after that, and it was only when he
came home this spring and happened to be in the same
neighbourhood that he found out about the accident.
He took the trouble to go over to Helston and see the
lawyer, Mr. Penwarren, who gave him my address.
I can't imagine why he should have bothered about me
at all, but for some extraordinary reason he seems to
have thought it was his duty.  Anyhow, he has
certainly gone out of his way to try and be kind to me,
and although I don't like him I naturally feel a certain
amount of gratitude.  He must be rather a nice man
really or he wouldn't have behaved as he has."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay you're right," said Colin doubtfully.  "I
have been told that the most objectionable people
often have hearts of gold."
</p>

<p>
He piloted her round the corner of Church Street
and led the way into a small garage, where a miscellaneous
collection of cars were ranged along the walls.
</p>

<p>
"This is mine," he remarked, coming to a halt in
front of a rather battered four-seater.  "She's not a
beauty to look at, but she can go like the devil."
</p>

<p>
Before Nancy could offer any comment a young man
in dirty overalls wriggled out from beneath a
neighbouring limousine.
</p>

<p>
Colin greeted him with a friendly nod.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to take her out after all, Davis," he
said.  "I shall be back some time this evening, and if
you're here we can run over her together."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Davis wiped his hands upon a piece of cotton
waste and glanced appreciatively at Nancy.  "Very
good, sir," he replied; "but, if you'll excuse my saying
so, I shouldn't drive too fast&mdash;not if you've got a lady
with you.  The steering gear's none too sound."
</p>

<p>
Colin laughed.  "You needn't pay any attention to
Davis," he observed to Nancy.  "Like all people who
have to give credit, he's a hopeless pessimist."
</p>

<p>
He opened the door for her, and, climbing up alongside
into the driving seat, switched on the spark and
the lamps.
</p>

<p>
With a slight shrug of his shoulders, as though to
disclaim further responsibility, Mr. Davis bent down
over the starting-handle.  After several ineffectual
jerks the engine suddenly began running, and the next
moment Colin was backing his way out through the
open doorway.
</p>

<p>
Sitting beside him, with her chin buried comfortably
inside her collar, Nancy made no attempt at conversation.
From the hint dropped by Mr. Davis she concluded
that Colin was the sort of driver whom it was
safer not to disturb with unnecessary chatter, an
opinion which had been fully confirmed some time before
they arrived at Sloane Square.
</p>

<p>
He drove, indeed, at a pace which would have proved
highly distressing to any one of a timid disposition.
Fortunately for Nancy, however, her nerves were in
excellent order, and after the first half mile had been
safely negotiated she began to find that the sensation
of missing buses by a quarter of an inch was not
without a peculiar and exhilarating charm.
</p>

<p>
Apart from that, the actual journey through what
to her was a totally unknown quarter of London was
in itself a sufficiently stimulating experience.  The
crowds in the City, the flaring coster barrows in
St. George's Road, and the gradually increasing squalor
and gloom as they drew nearer to their destination, all
provided her with an unfailing source of interest.
</p>

<p>
A little way down Shadwell High Street, at the
corner of a side lane, Colin came to a halt in front of
an uninviting-looking public house, alongside which
was a closed gate leading apparently into a yard.
</p>

<p>
"This is where I generally leave the car," he
announced.  "Mark's place is only a few yards farther on."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the door of the pub opened, and a
stout gentleman in trousers, carpet slippers, and a
rather dirty shirt loomed up in the opening.
</p>

<p>
"'Ullo, Mister Gray," he observed, in a kind of
hoarse wheeze.  "Quite a stranger, ain't yer?"
</p>

<p>
He spat genially into the gutter and, stepping
forward, offered his hand to Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Brought a bit o' comp'ny with yer this time, I see,"
he added.
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said Colin.  "Let me introduce you
to each other.  Mr. Higgins&mdash;Miss Seymour."
</p>

<p>
The fat man wiped his hand on the back of his
trousers and transferred it to Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Pleased to meet yer, miss," he remarked.  "Any
friend o' Mister Gray's a friend o' mine."
</p>

<p>
"Can I shove the car in your yard?" inquired Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, an' welcome," was the answer.  "You
sit where you are an' I'll open the gaite for yer."
</p>

<p>
He produced a key, and, having fumbled for a
moment with the rusty padlock, disclosed the entrance
to a narrow courtyard, the only occupant of which was
a surly-looking, red-eyed bull terrier, who was tethered
to an empty barrel.
</p>

<p>
"She's as saife 'ere as in the perlice station,"
continued Mr. Higgins, as the car came to a stand-still
against the wall.  "Saifer, I should say, from wot I
seen o' some o' them cops."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't wonder," said Colin with a laugh.  He
switched off the engine, and, getting out of the car,
proceeded to rid himself of his driving gloves.  "I
don't suppose we shall be very long," he added.
"We're only going to have a cup of tea with the doctor."
</p>

<p>
"You'll find me inside, any'ow," returned Mr. Higgins.
He stopped and fixed an admiring glance on
Nancy, who was pleasantly employed in tickling the
bull terrier's left ear.  "See that?" he continued with
a chuckle.  "Dang me if that don't taike the biscuit.
Scratchin' of 'is head saime as if 'e was a little lamb."
</p>

<p>
"I always select my friends on account of their
courage," explained Colin unconcernedly.
</p>

<p>
He strolled forward to the entrance, where Nancy
joined him, and the two of them waited on the
pavement while the gate was being refastened.  Then,
after declining the pressing offer of a little refreshment
from Mr. Higgins, they strolled off again along
the narrow and unsavoury thoroughfare which is the
nearest approach that Shadwell can boast to a main
street.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't judge the place entirely by its smells
and its appearance," said Colin.  "You will probably
find the people a bit rough at first, but they're a jolly
friendly lot really, and they all adore Mark.  When
they know you're working for him they'll be as nice to
you as possible."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they won't have the chance," returned
Nancy.  "As I said before, the doctor may be one of
those extraordinary people who expect to get
something useful in return for their money."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll soon settle that point, anyway,"
observed Colin.
</p>

<p>
He pulled up in front of an old-fashioned two-story
house, which had evidently survived from the days
when Shadwell was more or less a country village.  It
stood a little way back from the street behind some
battered iron railings, a brass plate on the door and
a red lamp over the side entrance affording sufficient
indications of its owner's profession.
</p>

<p>
Colin advanced to the front door and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
Its jangling had scarcely died away when there was
a sound of footsteps inside, and the next moment a
flood of light streamed out into the gloom.
</p>

<p>
A slim, sweet-faced woman, with beautiful but rather
tired gray eyes, was standing on the mat.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she saw who it was her expression lit up
in a smile of unaffected pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's Colin!" she exclaimed.  "How delightful!
I thought it was someone cadging for subscriptions."
</p>

<p>
Colin shook his head.  "It's not money we want,
lady," he said, "it's tea."  He pulled Nancy forward
into the light.  "By the way, let me introduce Miss
Nancy Seymour.  Nancy&mdash;Mary; Mary&mdash;Nancy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm so sorry.  Please forgive me.  I thought
you were alone."  She pressed Nancy's hand in a
friendly welcome, and then, stepping back, shepherded
them into the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Take Miss Seymour upstairs, Colin," she said.
"You'll find Mark in the study.  He's just finished
work.  You must excuse my deserting you for a
moment.  It's Martha Jane's day out, so I'm getting
tea."
</p>

<p>
"Can I help?" inquired Nancy.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head with another smile.  "Everything's
ready," she answered.  "You go along with
Colin, and I'll be up in a minute.  I've only got to
fetch the crumpets."
</p>

<p>
She disappeared in the direction of the back regions,
and having deposited his hat and coat on the hall table,
Colin led the way upstairs.
</p>

<p>
As they reached the first landing a door on the
right opened, and Mark himself appeared on the
threshold.  He had a large cherry-wood pipe in his
mouth, and he had discarded his frock coat in favour
of a Norfolk jacket.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Colin!" he exclaimed.  "I thought I heard
your musical voice.  Why the devil&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stopped short as he suddenly caught sight of
Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"You shouldn't swear in front of ladies," said Colin
reprovingly.  "It's not done in the best medical
circles."
</p>

<p>
Mark came forward with an embarrassed air.
</p>

<p>
"I say, please excuse me," he stammered.  "I didn't
see there was any one else there."
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," said Nancy, laughing.  "I've heard
the expression before&mdash;several times."
</p>

<p>
Colin looked at them both with mischievous amusement.
</p>

<p>
"Hadn't you better introduce us?" suggested Mark.
"It would be more useful than standing there grinning
like a Cheshire cat."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think it was necessary," said Colin.
"Surely you've guessed that you're talking to the
angel?"
</p>

<p>
Mark stared at him in bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"Talking to whom?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"The angel," repeated Colin.  "You asked me to
find you an angel, and here she is!"
</p>

<p>
A sudden light seemed to break in upon their host's
intelligence.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" he exclaimed.  "You don't say so!
Come along into the study."
</p>

<p>
He ushered them both into a snug, comfortably
furnished room, lined all round with books, where a
table was set out for tea and a bright fire was burning
in the grate.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Colin," he demanded, "were you pulling my
leg, or is this really a fact?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course it's a fact," said Colin, "and a very
nice one too."
</p>

<p>
"I can see that for myself," retorted Mark.  He
turned to Nancy and pushed forward a chair.  "Do sit
down," he added.  "You must forgive my being rather
stupid, but I really thought Colin was joking.  You see,
I only mentioned the matter to him a few hours ago."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't take me long to do a little job like that,"
said Colin, "not when I once start it."
</p>

<p>
Nancy was about to speak when she was interrupted
by a plaintive request from outside that someone would
open the door.  Colin hastened to comply, and Mrs. Mark,
carrying a teapot and a large covered plate,
sailed smilingly into the room.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful of the crumpets, Colin," she said, as he
relieved her of her burden.  "I have done them with
a double lot of butter in honour of your visit."
</p>

<p>
Mark laid his hand on his wife's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Mary," he said, wheeling her round so that she
faced Nancy, "do you know who this is?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do," was the answer.  "We were
introduced to each other on the doorstep.  I had no idea
that Colin had such nice friends."
</p>

<p>
"But you haven't heard the really thrilling part of
it.  This is the dream secretary who is going to get us
out of all our troubles."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how splendid!" exclaimed Mary, but before
she could add anything further Nancy rose to her feet
with a little protesting gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Please," she said, "please!  You're making me feel
the most dreadful humbug and impostor!"  She turned
to Colin.  "Do tell them the truth, Doctor Gray."
</p>

<p>
"I'm only waiting for the chance," said Colin.
</p>

<p>
With a good-natured chuckle Mark placed his pipe
on the mantelpiece, and pulled up a couple of chairs
to the table.
</p>

<p>
"Fire ahead, my lad," he observed.  "That's to
say, if you can eat crumpets and talk intelligibly at the
same time."
</p>

<p>
Spurred on by this encouragement, Colin set about
his task with obvious relish.  He was a good hand at
telling a story, and under his eloquent treatment the
slightly unusual circumstances which had attended his
first introduction to Nancy lost nothing in dramatic
freshness.  Retailed, indeed, amid the chink of
tea-cups and the pleasant crackling of the wood fire, they
seemed to appear more romantic than ever, and both
Mark and Mary listened to him with a fascinated
interest which showed itself plainly in their faces.
</p>

<p>
Having described the capture of "Ginger Dick"
and done full justice to the spirited behaviour of Nancy
during the operations, he went on to relate how he had
walked back with her to the studio, and had been
admitted into the secret of her profession.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he finished, "directly I heard that I
knew where I was.  You'd asked me to find you a
resourceful angel, and here she was fluttering round
Chelsea wasting her life typing out bad stories!  The
whole thing was evidently a put-up job on the part of
Providence."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to be like a direct answer to prayer," said
Mark, with considerable enthusiasm.  "I can hardly
believe it even now."
</p>

<p>
Mary leaned across and began refilling Nancy's cup.
"My dear," she begged, "please say that it's true.
You can't imagine how it will relieve our feelings.  If
Colin has been misrepresenting the situation I shall
burst into floods of tears."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid he has," declared Nancy, laughing,
"but only with regard to my qualifications.  If I
really thought that I could be of any use to you, there's
nothing I should like better than to come and work
here."
</p>

<p>
Mark rose to his feet and brandished the teacup
triumphantly over his head.
</p>

<p>
"This is magnificent," he exclaimed.  "What the
Prayer Book calls 'a happy issue out of all our
afflictions.'"
</p>

<p>
His wife regarded him with an affectionate smile.
"You had better control your feelings, Mark," she
said.  "If you go on like that Miss Seymour will
think you're mad, and she'll probably resign straight
away."  She turned to Nancy.  "I should hate to
say anything that could possibly put you off, but I
think it's only fair to give you a word of warning.
You are so young and so pretty that it seems a shame
you should bury yourself in Shadwell.  We do our
best to be cheerful, but, you know, a doctor's
practice in the East End of London is nearly all hard
work and no play.  You will probably find it horribly
depressing."
</p>

<p>
Nancy shook her head.  "I am not afraid of that,"
she said.  "I rather like hard work as long as it's
useful.  What I'm doubtful about is whether I can do
what you want."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, yes," exclaimed Mark hastily.  "It's
only just a matter of common sense.  Mary would
put you up to the ropes in half an hour."
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing now?" suggested the latter.
"Why don't you stay on here and have supper with
us?  There will be plenty of time before then to give
you a rough idea of what the work is like, and we can
settle up the whole thing straight away."
</p>

<p>
Mary glanced at Colin.  "It sounds a good idea,"
she agreed.  "I suppose I can get home by train?"
</p>

<p>
"You won't have to worry about that," said Colin.
"I'll take the car up to the garage and do my repairs,
and then come down again and join you here."
</p>

<p>
In a half-humorous, half-wistful fashion Nancy
looked round at all three of them.
</p>

<p>
"I am not used to people being so kind," she said.
"Unless somebody's disagreeable soon I am afraid
I shall begin to cry."
</p>

<p>
Mary came up to her and again squeezed her hands
affectionately.  "You must never cry in this house,
my dear," she said.  "It's the only form of
dissipation that Mark won't allow."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was exactly two and a half hours later when
Colin, straightening himself with a grunt, turned
triumphantly to the pessimistic Davis.
</p>

<p>
"I think we've fixed her this time," he observed,
wiping his hands on his dungaree trousers.  "It will
be nice to be able to push along at a reasonable pace
without feeling that something's going to give."
</p>

<p>
The other lifted up the front seat and thrust
away the spanner which he had been holding in his
hand.
</p>

<p>
"It didn't seem to make much difference," he
replied, "not judgin' by the way you started off this
afternoon.  I was half expectin' you and that young
lady to come back on a couple of stretchers."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we got along all right," said Colin.  "Miss
Seymour enjoyed the drive very much indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Did she?" was the somewhat incredulous answer.
"Well, I reckon if she knew the state that steering
gear was in she must be hard up for a bit of excitement."
</p>

<p>
Colin laughed, and, stripping off his overalls, stuffed
them away into an open locker.
</p>

<p>
"You had better let me have the key," he said.  "I
don't suppose I shall be back till about eleven.  I have
promised to go down to Shadwell for supper, only I
must slip round to the hospital and tidy myself up
first."
</p>

<p>
Davis handed over the desired article, and a few
minutes afterward, leaving his car in the gutter,
Colin hurried up the steps of St. Christopher's and
passed in through the swing doors.
</p>

<p>
On catching sight of him the porter stepped out
from his box.
</p>

<p>
"Telegram for you, sir," he announced.  "Come in
about a quarter of an hour ago."
</p>

<p>
Colin paused beneath the big centre light and,
ripping open the envelope, pulled out its contents.
</p>

<p>
The message was short but very much to the point:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Please call at the Red Lodge to-morrow
three-thirty.&mdash;CARTER."

<h3>
CHAPTER THREE
</h3>

<p>
In the days when a young and promising draper,
called Mr. John Barker, had recently opened a small
shop in the High Street, Kensington, Campden Hill
was a singularly attractive place to live in.  The
favourite resort of affluent artists, retired judges, and
other persons of culture and dignity, it still managed
to retain a semi-rural tranquillity unknown to any
other part of central London.
</p>

<p>
Time, however, which has dealt nobly with Mr. Barker,
has unfortunately robbed the district of most
of its former charm.  Of the old-fashioned houses
which stood formerly in their own pleasant grounds
only a sadly thinned remnant now survive.  Tucked
away in odd corners, amid an ever-encroaching flood of
"desirable modern residences," they seem to wait sadly
for the hour when, in a cloud of dust and mortar, the
relentless tapping of the pick serves for their funeral
bell.
</p>

<p>
The Red Lodge, the home of Professor Carter,
dated back to the leisured days of George the Third.
It was a square, creeper-clad house, surrounded by a
high wall, with a covered passageway leading up
from the street to the front door.  Through the
outside gate, the upper half of which consisted of an
iron grille, the curiously minded passer-by could, by
straining his neck, just obtain a glimpse into the
neglected garden.  Whether it were worth his while
to indulge in such contortions, however, was a matter
of some doubt, for a desolate expanse of ill-kept lawn,
dotted here and there with stunted bushes and overhung
by gaunt trees, was the only prospect that
rewarded his enterprise.
</p>

<p>
Standing on the pavement, Colin inspected what
was probably his future residence with a considerable
amount of curiosity.  He was not in the least fanciful,
but even to a thoroughly healthy imagination the old
house certainly presented a forlorn and rather mysterious
aspect.  There seemed to him nothing surprising
in the fact that, having once been burgled, the
Professor had begun to feel the need of a trustworthy
assistant, especially if he were engaged in researches
which would undoubtedly possess a large financial
value.
</p>

<p>
On the right of the gate a rusty bell-handle lolled
out dejectedly from its socket.  Colin gave it a
vigorous pull, and a distant jingling somewhere inside the
house told him that the wire was still in working
order.
</p>

<p>
Looking through the grille, he waited patiently
for the best part of a minute.  At last he heard the
sound of somebody fumbling with a chain, then the
front door opened, and an old, bent woman came
slowly down the steps.
</p>

<p>
Holding her shawl together with one hand, she
shuffled along to the end of the passage and peered
at him through the ironwork.
</p>

<p>
"Are you the gentleman that's expected?" she asked
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite likely," said Colin.  "Anyhow, I had a
telegram from Professor Carter asking me to call at
three-thirty."
</p>

<p>
"That must be right, then," was the somewhat
grudging answer, and, turning the lock, she pulled back
the gate just wide enough for him to enter.
</p>

<p>
Following her up the passageway and through the
front door, Colin found himself in a big, well-lighted
hall, at the back of which a couple of French windows
opened out into the garden behind.  Several pieces
of massive Victorian furniture were ranged symmetrically
round the walls, and a broad, thickly carpeted
staircase led up to the landing above.
</p>

<p>
"If you'll step into the library," observed his guide,
"I'll tell Mr. Carter you've come."
</p>

<p>
She opened a door on the right, and, accepting her
invitation, Colin passed through into a long, cheerless
apartment, three sides of which were almost
completely lined with books.  There was no fire in the
grate, and such chairs as there were looked so
extremely uncomfortable that only the most hardened
man of letters could have described it as an agreeable
resort.
</p>

<p>
Colin did not attempt to sit down.  After a cursory
glance round he walked over to the nearest bookcase
and began to examine the titles of some of the
volumes, all of which appeared to deal with scientific
subjects, a fair proportion of them being in French
and German.  He was deep in this occupation when
he heard the door open, and, wheeling round quickly,
he found the Professor coming toward him.
</p>

<p>
Like every other young investigator, Colin was
more or less familiar with photographs of his host,
but all the same the latter's appearance in real life
came to him with something of a shock.  A very old
man, wearing a skull cap, from which long white
hair hung down over his collar, he seemed at first
sight to be almost pitifully frail and feeble.  It was
only when a second glance revealed the gleam which
still lurked behind his gold spectacles and the dour,
obstinate lines of his mouth and chin that this sense
of physical weakness was swept away by a sudden
impression of extraordinary intellectual power and
immense force of character.
</p>

<p>
With a little exclamation of annoyance he advanced
to where Colin was standing.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry that you should have been left alone
in this ice house," he began in a high, quavering
voice.  "I can't imagine why Mrs. Ramsay showed
you in here, except that she happens to be a born
fool."
</p>

<p>
Colin accepted the thin, veined hand which the old
scientist offered him.
</p>

<p>
"I have been quite happy, thank you, sir," he said.
"I have been inspecting your library."
</p>

<p>
"I trust that you found something to entertain
you," was the answer.  "There are some interesting
books here, but, unfortunately, they are mixed up
with a good deal of trash.  Every ignoramus who
airs his views on some subject about which he knows
nothing seems to think it necessary to send me a
copy."  He turned toward the entrance.  "You had better
come into my study," he added.  "There is a nice fire
there, and we can talk in comfort."
</p>

<p>
Leading the way to the door, he conducted Colin
across the hall into another and almost similarly
shaped room exactly opposite.  Here also the walls
were lined with bookcases, but, thanks to the fire and
one or two easy chairs, there was a certain air of
homeliness altogether lacking in the library.
</p>

<p>
The Professor made a gesture towards a dilapidated
couch.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Mr. Gray," he continued.  "I don't
know whether you appreciate a good cigar, but if
you do I can offer you something a little out of the
ordinary.  Of course, if you are sufficiently young
and barbarous to prefer a pipe don't hesitate to say
so."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not an expert," admitted Colin.  "All
the same, I like to improve my education when I get
the chance."
</p>

<p>
The old man smiled grimly, and, moving across to
a black oak bureau in the corner, returned with a
box of long, delicately shaped Havanas.
</p>

<p>
"Smoking is the one pleasure left which I can still
enjoy," he explained.  "Under the circumstances, I
take particular care to have the best."
</p>

<p>
He waited until Colin had lighted up, and then,
following his example, placed the box on the table
between them and seated himself in a big armchair in
front of the fire.
</p>

<p>
"And now, my young friend," he said, "let us get to
business.  I believe that Onslow has said something
to you about my reasons for asking you to come and
see me."
</p>

<p>
Colin nodded.  "Sir George called at the hospital
yesterday," he said.  "I understood from him that
you were thinking of engaging a resident assistant,
and that he had suggested me as a possible choice."
</p>

<p>
The Professor drew down the corners of his mouth
in a dry smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you understood that, did you?" he remarked.
"Well, it's hardly the impression which Onslow
conveyed to me.  From the enthusiastic fashion in which
he spoke about your abilities I gathered that I should
be remarkably fortunate if you would even consider
the proposal."
</p>

<p>
Colin flushed handsomely.  "Sir George has always
been uncommonly kind to me," he said, "but he knows
that I should regard it as a tremendous honour to be
allowed to work under you."
</p>

<p>
The Professor looked at him over the top of his
spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am glad to hear you speak so sensibly.
Most clever young men are intolerably conceited."  He
paused.  "I think I ought to make the situation
quite plain before we go any further.  As Onslow may
have mentioned, this suggested arrangement of mine
isn't quite the compliment to your professional skill
which it appears to be on the surface."
</p>

<p>
Colin laughed.  "Yes, I know about that, sir," he
replied.  "I can only say that if you will allow me to
assist you in the daytime I don't care how many
burglars I have to tackle at night."
</p>

<p>
"It's hardly likely to be a regular feature of your
duties," returned the Professor.  "Still, the fact
remains that this house has been broken into once, and
there seems to be no apparent reason why the same
thing shouldn't happen again."
</p>

<p>
"Did you lose much?" asked Colin.
</p>

<p>
The old man shook his head.  "Nothing that I am
aware of.  My visitor, whoever he was, got into this
room by the window.  The only thing damaged was
that desk in the corner."  He nodded toward the black
oak bureau.  "The safe over there in which I generally
keep a certain amount of money, was absolutely
untouched."
</p>

<p>
"He might have been interrupted in the middle of
his job," suggested Colin.
</p>

<p>
"He might have been," assented the Professor, "but
as it happens he wasn't.  It was not until Mrs. Ramsay
came in here the next morning that we had the
least idea anything was wrong."
</p>

<p>
Colin leaned forward and knocked off his ash into
the fireplace.  "It seems rather an extraordinary
thing," he remarked.  "Had you any specially valuable
papers&mdash;I mean, anything like a description of
some new scientific process&mdash;which people might want
to get hold of?"
</p>

<p>
"I daresay I had," was the answer, "but if so it
was certainly not in that desk.  I keep everything
relating to my work in a special cabinet in the
laboratory.  You would think that a gentleman who was
sufficiently intelligent to try to steal things of that
nature would at least assure himself first that he was
on the right ground."
</p>

<p>
"What had the police got to say about it?" Colin
inquired.  "I suppose you called them in?"
</p>

<p>
"I did nothing of the sort," returned the Professor
abruptly.  "I have only a very limited amount of
time remaining to me, and there are plenty of excellent
ways in which I can occupy it.  Because some lunatic
chooses to break open my desk and rummage through
my papers I fail to see why I should waste several
valuable hours standing in a witness box answering
superfluous and probably impertinent questions.  All
the same, these sorts of experiences are extremely
upsetting to a man of my age.  They alarm the
household and they distract me from my work.
In case of a similar experience, I should be glad
to feel that there was someone on the premises
who could be trusted to act with promptness and
efficiency."
</p>

<p>
"You can depend on me for that," said Colin, "as
long as I'm not asleep."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause while the Professor took
off his spectacles and polished them with a red silk
handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now that we understand each other," he
continued, "I think it would be as well to discuss
one or two practical details.  With regard to your
remuneration, for instance.  I don't know what
you are getting at St. Christopher's, but I propose
to give you four hundred a year.  You will have no
expenses living in the house, so unless you are
foolishly extravagant that ought to be quite an adequate
salary."
</p>

<p>
"It will do me very nicely," said Colin.  "As a matter
of fact, I've got a little money of my own, and the
only extravagant habit I've developed so far is
keeping a car."
</p>

<p>
The Professor grunted.  "When I was your age,"
he remarked, "young men either walked or rode.
Still, as long as you are capable of amusing yourself
it doesn't matter to me how you spend your leisure
time."  He replaced his spectacles and returned
the handkerchief to his breast pocket "I shall give
instructions that you are to be properly looked after,
but whether they will be carried out is another
matter.  Since my man Kennedy left me I have had no
one in the house except Mrs. Ramsay and the cook.
They are both old, like myself, and my own wants
are so simple that their ideas of catering are probably
a little on the Spartan side.  If you find you are
uncomfortable, or that you are not getting enough to
eat and drink, you must let me know."  He paused.
"As for recreation or entertainment&mdash;well, if you are
expecting anything of that nature you are coming to
the wrong place.  The only visitor I ever have is my
solicitor, Mr. Medwin, whom, by the way, I am
expecting this afternoon.  I warn you frankly that
unless you can throw yourself into your work you will
find life here intolerably dull."
</p>

<p>
Colin shook his head.  "I don't think we need discuss
that, sir," he said cheerfully.  "Anyway, as far
as my present feelings are concerned I wouldn't change
places with any one in England."
</p>

<p>
With another and rather more approving grunt the
Professor hoisted himself slowly out of his chair.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have some sense, my young friend,"
he observed.  "How would you like to come along
and look at the laboratory?  I don't suppose Medwin
will be here for another twenty minutes."
</p>

<p>
"I should like it very much," said Colin promptly.
</p>

<p>
He rose to his feet, and, dropping the stump of
his cigar into the fire, followed his host out of the
room and along the hall.  On reaching the French
windows the Professor turned to the left, and, having
descended a couple of steps, pulled up in front of a
solid-looking door, which he proceeded to unlock with
a Yale key.
</p>

<p>
"This, of course, is not part of the original house,"
he explained.  "I had it built on about twenty years
ago, and one way and another it's cost me a pretty
penny, I can tell you."
</p>

<p>
He led the way inside, and, with an air of pride
that he made no effort to conceal, turned on the
electric light.
</p>

<p>
For a private laboratory the place was certainly
unique.  A large, lofty room, roofed with glass and
lined with white tiles, it appeared to have been fitted
up with a complete disregard for expense that would
have excited envy in the most lavishly endowed
American university.
</p>

<p>
For several seconds Colin stood looking round in
voiceless appreciation.  His eyes wandered in turn
over the shining array of taps and switches, the enamelled
basins, the big electric furnace, and all the other
up-to-date appliances which gleamed invitingly under
the hard, unshaded light.
</p>

<p>
At last, with a sigh of satisfaction, he turned to the
Professor.
</p>

<p>
"As long as I can work here," he said, "I don't care
what I have to eat or drink."
</p>

<p>
Evidently pleased with his companion's enthusiasm,
the old man closed the door carefully behind them,
and, having replaced the key in his pocket, started
off on an explanatory tour of the room.  With the
absorption of an expert loosed upon his favourite
topic, he moved methodically along from one spot
to another, stopping in front of each object in turn
to explain or demonstrate its various uses.
</p>

<p>
Colin, who was more than content to play the part
of a listener, followed him round in absolute silence.
Familiar as he was with all the latest developments in
research, his acquaintance with many branches was
naturally of a rather superficial nature, and, although
he was prepared for something of the sort, the apparent
depth and accuracy of the Professor's knowledge
filled him with amazed respect.
</p>

<p>
To what height this feeling might have attained
it is impossible to say, for just as they had arrived
at the electric furnace a sudden tap on the door
interrupted their proceedings.
</p>

<p>
With an impatient click of his tongue the aged
scientist glanced sharply round in the direction of the
sound.
</p>

<p>
"Now who the devil's that?" he exclaimed.  "I
have given orders repeatedly that when I'm in here
I am not to be disturbed."
</p>

<p>
He shuffled wrathfully down the room, and, jerking
open the door, revealed the lean figure of Mrs. Ramsay.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" he demanded.  "Why don't
you obey my instructions?"
</p>

<p>
"It's no good getting cross," returned the housekeeper
impassively.  "You asked Mr. Medwin to call,
and you can't leave 'im sitting in the study."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's come, has he?" was the slightly mollified
answer.  "Well, in that case I suppose we had better
go along and make ourselves civil to him."  He
turned to Colin, who had followed him to the door.
"You will stay to tea, of course?" he added.
</p>

<p>
Colin, who was trying hard not to smile, expressed
his willingness, and, having closed and locked the
laboratory, the Professor conducted him back
through the hall to the room which they had recently
quitted.
</p>

<p>
A big, clean-shaven, middle-aged man, who was
standing in front of the fire, stepped forward at their
entrance.
</p>

<p>
"I hope I am not too punctual," he began, in a
curiously smooth voice.  "I think four o'clock was the
time you mentioned in your letter."
</p>

<p>
He shook hands with his host, and at the same
time his glance travelled inquisitively toward Colin.
</p>

<p>
"That's quite correct," replied the Professor.  "I
was just showing the laboratory to my young friend
here.  By the way, let me introduce you.  Doctor
Gray&mdash;Mr. Medwin."
</p>

<p>
Colin felt his hand enveloped in a large, soft palm,
while a pair of very acute eyes rapidly scanned his
face.
</p>

<p>
"I am delighted to meet you," said Mr. Medwin.
</p>

<p>
"It's a pleasure that you will probably have on
future occasions," observed the Professor.  "Doctor
Gray is coming to live here as my resident assistant."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Colin that in spite of his bland manner
the lawyer was momentarily disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
"Really," he observed, after a slight hesitation, "I
had no idea that you were contemplating anything of
that sort."
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose you had," said the Professor drily.
"The idea only occurred to me last week, but when I
make up my mind I generally act upon it at once.  If
you will forgive my saying so, Medwin, it's a habit
that some members of your profession might cultivate
with advantage."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin, who appeared to have recovered his
self-possession, smiled affably.
</p>

<p>
"I won't dispute the statement," he said.  "There's
no doubt that, taking us altogether, we're a dilatory
lot."
</p>

<p>
The arrival of Mrs. Ramsay with the tea made a
temporary diversion, and, having requested Colin to
officiate, the Professor seated himself on the couch
alongside his visitor.
</p>

<p>
"What I chiefly wanted to see you about," he
began, "was that new agreement with the American
Dye Company.  I had a letter from them yesterday,
and, with their usual transatlantic hustle, they are
anxious to get the matter settled up at once."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's no reason why it shouldn't be,"
returned the other.  "I went through the papers last
night, and they all seem to be in order.  If I had
known you were in a hurry I would have brought
them along."  He paused.  "Perhaps Doctor Gray
would be good enough to stroll back with me as far as
my house after tea.  In that case I can hand them over
to him.  I would fetch them myself, but,
unfortunately, I have an engagement."
</p>

<p>
"I can manage that all right," said Colin.  "I sha'n't
be wanted at the hospital until seven."
</p>

<p>
He finished pouring out the tea, and, having
distributed the cups, took the vacant seat on the farther
side of the fireplace.
</p>

<p>
Somehow or other the personality of the big, suave
solicitor had already inspired him with a vague
distrust.  He always disliked men with soft hands and
that particular type of voice, especially when, as in the
present case, their eyes were unpleasantly close
together.
</p>

<p>
He had, too, an instinctive feeling that, in spite of
his apparent friendliness, Mr. Medwin was by no
means disposed to regard him as a desirable addition
to the Red Lodge.  Whether it was a mere whim of
the latter's, or whether he resented the prospect of
anybody else being mixed up with the Professor's
business affairs, it was impossible to guess.  The only
thing Colin felt sure about was that the announcement
of his engagement had come to the other as a
distinctly unwelcome surprise.
</p>

<p>
After chatting away amiably for about twenty
minutes, Mr. Medwin at length rose to his feet and
announced that it was time for him to be taking his
departure.
</p>

<p>
"I live quite close by, in Albert Terrace," he added,
turning to Colin, "so if you are in no special hurry
it's hardly worth while bothering about a taxi.  You
can walk there and back in a quarter of an hour."
</p>

<p>
"And I shall be extremely obliged to you for your
trouble, Gray," interposed the Professor.  "It will
be a great convenience to me to have the papers
to-night.  I am really beginning to wonder how I have
managed to get along all this time without you."
</p>

<p>
Colin laughed, and, picking up his hat from the
side table where he had originally placed it, followed
the still smiling Mr. Medwin out into the hall and
along the covered passageway.
</p>

<p>
They exchanged no remark until the iron gate had
closed behind them, when, turning down the hill, his
new acquaintance addressed him with an air of
good-natured amusement.
</p>

<p>
"A queer character, our old friend," he observed.
"I always say he might have stepped bodily out of
one of Dickens's books."  He paused, and eyed Colin
again with that sharp, penetrating glance of his.
"Have you known him long?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"Not very," said Colin.  "About an hour, to be exact."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin raised his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"Really!" he exclaimed.  "Then I suppose your
arrangement to come and live at the Red Lodge was
only decided this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
Colin nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what put the idea into his head,"
continued the lawyer.  "It's almost the last thing one
would have expected from such a confirmed old
hermit."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Colin hesitated.  The question was
natural enough, but since the Professor had chosen
to remain silent he thought it better to keep his own
counsel.
</p>

<p>
"There is a lot of hard work in connection with
research," he replied.  "When a man gets to his
age he's bound to require a certain amount of
help."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, that's true, of course," assented the other.
"As a matter of fact, I have suggested to him several
times myself that he was overtaxing his strength.  The
only thing that surprises me is his proposal that you
should live in the house."  He paused.  "If you
won't think me inquisitive, may I ask how you came to
make his acquaintance?"
</p>

<p>
"There was nothing very remarkable about it,"
said Colin.  "I happen to be house surgeon at
St. Christopher's, and Sir George Onslow, one of the
visiting physicians, was good enough to mention my
name to him."
</p>

<p>
"I have often heard of St. Christopher's," returned
Mr. Medwin pleasantly.  "A client of mine, Lord
Cleveland, was vice-chairman for several years.  You'll
find your new existence rather dull, won't you, after
the life and bustle of a big hospital?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't expect to," said Colin.  "I am extremely
interested in research work, and from what I have
seen of the Professor I think we shall get along
together very nicely."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke they came out into the High Street,
and, not knowing which way to turn, he glanced
inquiringly at his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Straight across the road," said Mr. Medwin.
"It's only just round the corner out of Kensington
Square."
</p>

<p>
They made their way through the traffic, and a
few minutes' walk brought them to a row of small
white, semi-detached houses, each one standing back
behind a narrow strip of garden.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin pulled up in front of the third, and
opened the gate for Colin.
</p>

<p>
"This is my chateau," he announced.  "Not quite
so magnificent as the Red Lodge, but it does well
enough for a middle-aged bachelor."
</p>

<p>
He proceeded up the path, and, unlocking the front
door, ushered Colin into a tiny hall, the walls of which
were hung round with valuable sporting prints.
</p>

<p>
"I prefer a small house to a flat," he continued,
"and I am lucky enough to have a French manservant
and his wife, who run the entire place for me."
</p>

<p>
He opened a door to the left, and, switching on the
electric light, revealed a charmingly furnished dining-room.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you won't mind waiting in here for a
moment," he added.  "You will find some whisky and
soda and a box of cigarettes on the sideboard.  Make
yourself at home while I go and fetch the papers."
</p>

<p>
With another genial smile he disappeared into the
opposite apartment, and, accepting his invitation,
Colin strolled across the room and helped himself to
a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
It was quite evident that, although he was
contented with a small house, Mr. Medwin was a
gentleman of taste and means.  The fine Persian carpet,
the harmoniously coloured curtains, and the admirably
preserved Chippendale chairs could only have
been the choice of a man who was blessed with an
ample income and a cultivated feeling for beautiful
surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Having surveyed everything with leisurely
appreciation, Colin mixed himself a drink and sauntered
back to the fireplace.  He had taken a sip and was
reaching up to deposit his glass upon the mantelpiece
when a small photograph in a silver frame suddenly
attracted his attention.  He paused mid-way and
stared at it with interest.  It was a snapshot of a man
upon horseback&mdash;a rough amateur effort, apparently
taken just before the start of a steeplechase.
</p>

<p>
The rider's face was turned full toward him, and,
slightly out of focus as the negative was, the features
seemed curiously familiar.  He lifted it down and
examined it more closely.  The impression that it
was a picture of someone whom he had met became
stronger than ever, but although he racked his memory
he could get no nearer toward placing the original.
</p>

<p>
He was still puzzling over the problem when he
heard footsteps crossing the hall.  Replacing the
frame in its former position, he faced round toward
the door, and the next moment Mr. Medwin entered
carrying a large envelope in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"There are the papers," he said, handing them to
Colin.  "I am sorry to have kept you waiting."  His
eye fell upon the glass, and with an approving nod he
turned away in the direction of the sideboard.  "I
think I shall have to follow your example," he added,
"if it's merely to drink success to your new venture."
</p>

<p>
He splashed some spirit into a tumbler and filled it
up with water.
</p>

<p>
"My best wishes!" he said heartily, "and I hope
that the experiment will prove a complete success."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so, too," returned Colin.  "It certainly
looks promising enough as far as it's gone at present."
</p>

<p>
The lawyer emptied his glass and replaced it beside
the tantalus.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very interested to hear how you get
on," he continued.  "The Professor is a wonderful
old gentleman, but of course he's inclined to be a trifle
eccentric.  With a little tact, however, I think you
ought to manage him excellently.  As soon as you
have settled down you must come round to dinner one
night and tell me all about it."
</p>

<p>
Colin made some conventional reply to the effect
that he would be delighted, though, as a matter of
strict accuracy, the prospect of his confiding in
Mr. Medwin seemed to him to be a particularly remote
one.
</p>

<p>
However, he shook hands cordially enough, and,
escorted by his host as far as the garden gate, started
off briskly down the terrace on his return journey.
</p>

<p>
He had reached the corner and was just turning
into Kensington Square when his thoughts suddenly
went back to the photograph which he had been
examining in the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment a flash of memory darted
through his mind, and he pulled up short with a
half-stifled exclamation.
</p>

<p>
He knew now!
</p>

<p>
It was a portrait of Major Fenton, the man to whom
Nancy had introduced him outside her studio.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER FOUR
</h3>

<p>
Colin finished his coffee and looked inquiringly across
the table.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any special plans for this afternoon?"
he asked.  "If not, I thought I'd get on with that
new parcel of stuff from Paris.  The sooner it's
sorted out and classified the better."
</p>

<p>
The Professor, who was engaged in selecting a
cigar, stopped in the middle of the operation.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see, Gray," he observed, "how long have
you been with me?"
</p>

<p>
Colin reflected for a moment.  "I came on a
Wednesday," he said.  "That will be three weeks
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"And I believe," continued the Professor, "that
except for a few occasional pauses for sleep and
refreshment, you have spent the whole of that period
shut up in the laboratory."
</p>

<p>
Colin gave a protesting laugh.  "Well, I wanted to
get the hang of things as soon as possible," he replied.
"I can stand a lot of work provided it's interesting."
</p>

<p>
"That appears to be the truth," admitted his
employer.  "All the same, every piece of machinery has
its breaking-point, and, as I am beginning to find you
extremely useful, I have no wish that you should
suddenly collapse.  You will therefore oblige me by going
out into the open air and not showing your face inside
this house again until bedtime."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please, sir," said Colin, pushing back
his chair.  "I suppose it would be no use my suggesting
that you should try a little of the same prescription
yourself?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor shook his head.  "I am more favourably
situated than you, my young friend," he replied.
"In the course of nature I shall soon have
all the rest that I need."  He chuckled at his own
sombre jest, and, coming forward, laid his hand on
Colin's shoulder.  "You have been of very real assistance,
to me, Gray," he added, "but there is no sense
in flogging a willing horse.  I can quite well spare
you to-day, so off you go, whether you like it or not."
</p>

<p>
Colin, who had been long enough at the Red Lodge
to know the futility of arguing, at once rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"I will see if I can rout out Mark Ashton," he said,
"that doctor pal of mine I was telling you about the
other day.  I should think that with any luck we
ought to be able to carry on until midnight."
</p>

<p>
He accepted a cigar which the Professor offered
him, and, making his way to the telephone in the hall,
rang up the Shadwell surgery.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" came a voice, "Who's that?  Colin?
Why, good Lord, man, we thought you were dead!"
</p>

<p>
"Why should I be dead?" retorted Colin.  "I'm
not one of your patients."
</p>

<p>
He heard a laugh at the other end of the wire.
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact," he continued, "I'm just
starting off to pay you a visit."
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!" was the answer.  "Mary's still away
up North, but you'll find me here, and Miss Seymour,
too.  What more could you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," assented Colin.  "I was going to suggest
that if you can get away this evening I should take you
both out to a theatre."
</p>

<p>
"No chance of that," replied Mark regretfully.
"At least, not so far as I'm concerned.  I might spare
Miss Seymour if you'll do something for me on your
way here."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I left an umbrella in a taxi last night, a very
superior umbrella, with Mark Ashton engraved on the
handle.  If you're driving down you might look in at
the Lost Property Office and see whether it's turned
up."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," said Colin.  "I shall be along in
about an hour."
</p>

<p>
He hung up the receiver, and, putting away the
Professor's cigar in an inside pocket, donned his hat
and coat and proceeded to leave the house.
</p>

<p>
A little way down the hill, in a side mews off
Vicarage Gardens, he had discovered a new garage,
to which he had recently transferred his patronage.
The car was ready for him, and a few minutes later
he was seated at the driving wheel, skilfully threading
his way through the crowded traffic that renders High
Street, Kensington, such a stimulating thoroughfare.
</p>

<p>
Big Ben was in the act of striking three as he arrived
at Westminster Bridge.  He pulled up outside the
entrance to the Lost Property Office, and, pushing
open the swing door, advanced to the counter, where a
stalwart constable was thoughtfully scratching his
head with the stump of a pencil.
</p>

<p>
Having listened in silence to Colin's inquiry, the
man got down from his seat and disappeared into
the back regions, returning almost immediately with
the umbrella in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to sign your name here," he announced,
pushing forward an official-looking paper.
</p>

<p>
"And there'll be two and sixpence reward for the
driver."
</p>

<p>
Without entering upon any superfluous explanations,
Colin paid over the desired sum, and, after
neatly forging Mark's signature, made his way back
to the car.  He was leaning over the side door,
storing away his trophy, when a gruff voice suddenly
addressed him from the pavement behind.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor Gray, unless I'm much mistaken!"
</p>

<p>
Turning round promptly, he found himself face to
face with the burly, shrewd-eyed figure of Inspector
Marsden.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I was right," continued the detective.
"It's part of my business to recognize people by their
back view."
</p>

<p>
Colin gripped the large and efficient-looking hand
which the speaker extended to him.
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully glad to see you again," he said heartily.
"I hope you're none the worse for that little
dust-up in the King's Road?"
</p>

<p>
"Still a bit sore in the ribs," was the answer.  "I
fancy the beauty who got that kick in must have been
a footballer at some time or other in his career.  I'll
give him football if I ever find out which of 'em it
was."
</p>

<p>
"How about our ginger-haired friend?" inquired
Colin.  "I've been expecting to hear every day that
I was wanted as a witness."
</p>

<p>
"You'll be wanted all right," replied the Inspector.
"He's under remand at present, and I don't suppose
the case will come on for another month.  There are
several pretty black marks against Master Dick, and
we hope to collect enough evidence to put him out of
business for some considerable period."  He paused.
"By the way," he added, "if you've a few minutes to
spare, come along up to our place and let me introduce
you to one or two of the boys.  I told them what you
did for us the other day, and they'd be glad of the
chance of shaking hands with you."
</p>

<p>
Knowing that Mark was unlikely to be free until
four o'clock, Colin decided that he might as well
accept the invitation.  He had never been inside
Scotland Yard, and the prospect rather appealed to
him.
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do with the car?" he asked.  "Leave
it here?"
</p>

<p>
"Better bring it into the yard," said the Inspector.
"No one will try to pinch it then&mdash;not unless he's a
bit of an optimist."
</p>

<p>
Getting into his seat, Colin started forward alongside
his companion, and turned in through the big iron
gates which guard the headquarters of the London
Police Force.
</p>

<p>
There were several other cars standing against the
wall, and, leaving his own in company with them, he
followed the Inspector through a low doorway and up
a long flight of stone stairs.
</p>

<p>
They emerged into a broad corridor with doors on
either side.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are!" announced his guide, halting in
front of the second.  "I don't know who's on duty
to-day, but we're sure to find somebody about."
</p>

<p>
He led the way into a large, business-like apartment,
the principal furniture of which consisted of a couple
of roll-top desks.  At one of them was seated an
alert-looking man in a well-cut blue suit, who glanced
up sharply at their entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Pat!" said the Inspector.  "I've got someone
here I want to introduce you to.  This is Doctor
Gray of St. Christopher's Hospital."
</p>

<p>
The other laid down his pen, and, rising from his
chair, shook Colin's hand.
</p>

<p>
"You're welcome, sir," he said, with a distinctly
Irish accent.  "We have heard all about you from
our friend Marsden.  My name is O'Brien&mdash;Inspector
Patrick O'Brien.  I am pleased to have the privilege
of making your acquaintance."
</p>

<p>
"It's very nice of you to put it like that," said Colin.
"I don't think I deserve any particular compliments,
though.  I only did what any one else would have done
who had happened to be on the spot."
</p>

<p>
Both men smiled.
</p>

<p>
"That may be your impression," was the answer,
"but you can take it from me that you're a trifle off
the mark.  Watching a police officer kicked to death
is one of the public's favourite entertainments."
</p>

<p>
"O'Brien comes from Dublin, you see," put in Marsden,
"so you must make allowances for a touch of
bitterness."  He pulled forward a chair, and, thrusting
his hand into his pocket, produced a large rubber
pouch.  "Make yourself comfortable and try a pipe
of this tobacco, doctor," he added.  "It was given to
me by a ship's captain, and they don't generally go far
wrong&mdash;not from what I've seen of them."
</p>

<p>
Colin took the proffered seat, and, drawing out his
briar, proceeded to fill it carefully with the fragrant
brown flakes.
</p>

<p>
"I'm rather interested in 'Ginger Dick,'" he
remarked.  "One would hardly take him for a Napoleon
of crime, judging by his appearance."
</p>

<p>
"No, his looks aren't anything to shout about,"
agreed Marsden.  "All the same, he's a dangerous
little devil if ever there was one.  As I told you the
other day, he's in with all the lowest scum of the Turf,
and, thanks to him and his crowd, there are several of
our boys on the retired list, and likely to remain
there."
</p>

<p>
"It never occurred to me before," said Colin, "but
I suppose there are healthier occupations than being
a detective on a racecourse."
</p>

<p>
"You can back on that," was O'Brien's rejoinder.
"I've had some of it myself, and, though I'm partial
to what you may call an active life, I wasn't exactly
sorry when they shifted me to another department."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him some of your experiences, Pat," suggested
Inspector Marsden.  "It's no use having a distinguished
guest if you don't try to entertain him."
</p>

<p>
The Irishman, who apparently only needed this
encouragement, plunged at once into a series of
reminiscences, all dealing with that dark underworld of
ruffianism which lurks furtively beneath the brilliant
surface of racing.  He told his stories well, and Colin,
who knew little or nothing about the Turf, listened to
him with absorbed interest.  It was not, indeed, until
the hands of the office clock were pointing to the
half-hour that he reluctantly knocked out his pipe into the
fireplace and rose from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"I hate to break up this cheerful party," he said
truthfully, "but I've promised to be down in Shadwell
by four, and I've got an unpleasant sort of feeling
that I must be keeping you both from your work."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you needn't worry about that," replied Marsden,
smiling.  "I'm fixed here until midnight anyway,
and, no matter how busy Pat is, he can always find
time to talk."
</p>

<p>
"I want to hear some more of his reminiscences,"
said Colin, "and yours, too.  Perhaps if you could
both get away together the same evening you would
come out and feed with me?  We could go to the
Cheshire Cheese or somewhere like that.  I can't ask
you to my place, because at present I'm acting as
bottle-washer to Professor Carter."
</p>

<p>
"The Cheshire Cheese sounds all right to me," said
O'Brien approvingly.  "You give us a ring when
you've got a spare night, and we'll try and fix it up."
</p>

<p>
"Things are getting altogether too one-sided,"
objected Marsden.  "Can't you think of a little
service we could do for you, doctor, just by way of
a change?"
</p>

<p>
Colin was on the point of making some laughing
disclaimer, when an idea suddenly occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
"Would it be a lot of trouble to get me some
information about a man I was introduced to the other
day?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," replied Marsden.  "What's his name?"
</p>

<p>
"Fenton," said Colin.  "Major Fenton.  He's a
chap of about forty-five, tall, clean-shaven, with rather
a red face.  All I know about him is that he has been
a long time abroad, and that at present he is living in
London and drives a Daimler car.  It's only a matter
of personal curiosity, but if you could find out who he
is and what sort of reputation he has I should be
uncommonly grateful."
</p>

<p>
Marsden jotted down the particulars and folded up
the paper.
</p>

<p>
"That ought to be simple enough," he replied.
"I'll hand this over to Ainsworth, who's in charge
of all that kind of thing, and if you look us up in about
a week we shall probably be able to give you the
gentleman's life history."
</p>

<p>
Colin expressed his thanks, and, having shaken
hands with each of them in turn, made his way back
down the staircase and out into the main courtyard.
</p>

<p>
Resuming his journey eastward, he followed the
Embankment as far as Blackfriars Bridge, where he
struck off through a maze of side streets, which
eventually brought him out close to the grimy and retired
tavern presided over by Mr. Higgins.
</p>

<p>
The yard door was open, and a glance inside
revealed the burly outline of the proprietor himself,
engaged in the domestic task of washing his bull
terrier.  On hearing the car he paused in his
operations and signalled to Colin to enter.
</p>

<p>
"Bring 'er along in, mister," he called out.  "Bring
'er along in, an' look out for that bleedin' bucket."
</p>

<p>
Carrying out these instructions successfully, Colin
jerked forward over the cobblestones until he came to
a halt alongside the seated figure.
</p>

<p>
"Pleased to see yer," continued Mr. Higgins, in a
hospitable tone.  "Quite a time since you was 'ere
last, ain't it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's getting on for a month," admitted Colin, as
he clambered out of the car.  "In fact I've not been
since the night I brought Miss Seymour."
</p>

<p>
At the mention of Nancy's name the landlord's
mottled face wreathed itself into a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't know then that you was goin' to leave 'er
be'ind yer," he observed jocularly.  "Thought you'd
give us a kind of pleasant surprise, eh, guv'nor?"
</p>

<p>
"That was the idea," replied Colin.  "I was just
going to ask you if you'd seen anything of her."
</p>

<p>
"I done more than that," was the proud rejoinder;
"I've 'ad a talk with 'er, I 'ave.  I 'appened to be
outside when she come by last Thursday, an' she
stopped and chatted away as friendly as kiss me 'and.
Ah, she's one o' the right sort, she is; no blarsted
frills nor nonsense about 'er."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose she'll be quite safe going about alone?"
said Colin.  "People know she's working for the doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Lor' love yer, yus," ejaculated Mr. Higgins.  "No
one wouldn't interfere with 'er, not round 'ere.  This
ain't the West End.  We knows 'ow to be'ave
ourselves in Shadwell."
</p>

<p>
"I'm just going along to the surgery now," said
Colin.  "I'll tell her some of the nice things you've
been saying about her."
</p>

<p>
"You do," was the answer.  "An' you can add,
with my best respecks, mister, that if ever she'd
honour this 'ouse by droppin' in and takin' a cup o' tea,
there'd be no prouder man than Bill 'Iggins, not in the
'ole of London."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later, with a pleasant tingle of anticipation
in his heart, Colin mounted the steps of Mark's
residence and jerked briskly at the bell.  The door
was opened by Martha Jane, the fat, grubby-faced
little maid-of-all-work, who welcomed him with the
grin of an old acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
"You'll find 'em hupstairs in the study," she
announced, in answer to his inquiry.  "I know they're
expectin' you, 'cos the doctor told me not to bring tea
till you came."
</p>

<p>
"Well, here I am," said Colin.  "Is there anything
good to eat?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm makin' scones," replied Martha Jane.  "Some
o' them yaller ones, wot you gen'rally seems to fancy."
</p>

<p>
Colin stepped inside and deposited Mark's umbrella
in the hat stand.
</p>

<p>
"You push off and continue the good work," he
remarked.  "I'll find my own way up."
</p>

<p>
Still grinning, Martha Jane closed the front door
and shuffled along the passage toward the kitchen.
Just as she disappeared there was a sound on the
landing above and Mark's spectacled face protruded
itself over the banisters.
</p>

<p>
"You've been a devil of a time coming," he observed.
"We were beginning to think you must have
had a breakdown."
</p>

<p>
"I like that!" retorted Colin, struggling out of his
overcoat.  "Here have I been chasing all round London
after your infernal umbrella&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you've got it, have you?" interrupted Mark.
"That's topping.  You don't know how deeply
indebted I am to you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do," said Colin.  "Exactly half-a-crown&mdash;what
I had to give the cabman as a reward for his
honesty."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's face appeared suddenly beside that of
her employer and smiled down at him in friendly
welcome.
</p>

<p>
"Please don't start quarrelling about money," she
said pathetically.  "I'm simply dying for a cup of
tea."
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be something strangely familiar
and attractive to Colin in the mere sound of her voice,
and, running lightly up the staircase, he pressed both
their hands in a simultaneous greeting.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so sorry," he exclaimed.  "I was forgetting
the brutal way in which Mark always treats his staff.
I suppose he has been working you to death and half
starving you at the same time."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I have," declared Mark.  "Look at her
worn and haggard appearance."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we haven't been exactly idle," admitted
Nancy, laughing.  "All the same, I think I am bearing
up pretty well."
</p>

<p>
Mark led the way into the study, where a table was
already laid, and waved his hand toward the largest
of the armchairs.
</p>

<p>
"You take the seat of honour, Colin," he said.
"It's a privilege we always keep for distinguished
strangers."
</p>

<p>
"There's no need to rub it in," objected Colin.
"I should have looked you up ages ago if it hadn't
been for my devotion to duty.  This is the first
holiday I've had since I went to the Professor's."
</p>

<p>
"How are you getting on?" asked Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Up to the present," replied Colin modestly, "I
think I have given what they call complete satisfaction."
</p>

<p>
"What's the old man like?" demanded Mark.
"Easy to live with?"
</p>

<p>
Colin hesitated.  "It all depends," he answered.
"We've managed to hit it off well enough, but then
I've rather gone out of my way to humour his little
weaknesses.  He's one of the sort that you've just
got to take or leave.  As long as you do exactly what
he wants he's kindness itself.  If any one tried to
oppose him or contradict him I should think he could
be distinctly unpleasant."
</p>

<p>
"There must be a lot of people about like that,"
said Nancy.  "At least, I seem to have run up against
a good few."
</p>

<p>
"And how do you stand with regard to the job?"
inquired Mark.  "I suppose he doesn't let you into
more secrets than he can possibly help?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, he does," replied Colin.  "He lets me into
everything.  I've soaked up so much knowledge the
last three weeks that I'm beginning to wonder whether
there's anything left to learn."
</p>

<p>
Mark gazed at him with a certain amount of
incredulity.  "Do you mean to say that if he died
to-morrow you would be in a position to carry on his
work?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd have a damn good shot at it, anyway," declared
Colin.  "Of course, I haven't a quarter of his ability,
but he's discussed all his ideas with me, and explained
them in such detail that if I couldn't make something
or other out of them I should be next door to an
idiot."
</p>

<p>
Mark turned to Nancy and nodded his head.  "It's
panning out just as I prophesied," he said sadly.  "We
sha'n't see much more of him at Shadwell.  Before we
can look round he'll be splashing about in a
Rolls-Royce and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His prediction was cut short by the sudden appearance
of Martha Jane, who lurched in through the
doorway carrying a large tray and breathing
somewhat heavily from her exertions.
</p>

<p>
"I vote that we adjourn the discussion of my
future," suggested Colin, as they pulled up their chairs
round the table.  "It's your private affairs that
interest me, Mark.  As the person responsible for the
engagement I want to know whether you are pleased
with your new assistant."
</p>

<p>
Nancy, who had seated herself in front of the tray,
paused with the teapot in mid-air.
</p>

<p>
"This is very embarrassing," she observed.  "Hadn't
I better leave the room for a few moments?"
</p>

<p>
"You go on pouring out," said Mark firmly.  "You
can blush just as well here as in the passage."  He
helped himself to a scone and pushed the plate across
the table toward Colin.  "When you told us you'd
found an angel, my lad," he continued, "you were
speaking the literal truth.  I had no idea that there
was another such woman in the world apart from
Mary."
</p>

<p>
"Don't listen to him," interrupted Nancy hastily.
"The truth is that both he and Mrs. Ashton are so
ridiculously good-natured that they hadn't the heart
to turn me away."
</p>

<p>
"I know Mary's opinion already," said Colin.  "I
had a touching little letter from her just before she
went North.  She seems to regard me as a highly
successful understudy of Providence."
</p>

<p>
"And, by Gad, it's true!" broke in Mark with
enthusiasm.  "I should have been absolutely in the soup
without Miss Seymour.  She's simply splendid, Colin.
Down here at nine o'clock every morning, and working
away like a galley slave until seven or eight in the
evening."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's what I'm paid for," objected Nancy.
"And, besides, I don't look on it as work.  I so enjoy
the feeling that I'm doing something useful, instead
of sitting all day typing out a lot of stories that nobody
wants to read."
</p>

<p>
"What do the patients think of the arrangement?"
asked Colin.  "I gathered from Mr. Higgins that
it's one of the principal topics of local interest."
</p>

<p>
"It's been the best advertisement I ever had,"
replied Mark, with a chuckle.  "I was a little doubtful
at first, so I've told everybody that Miss Seymour
and Mary are first cousins.  We're rather strong on
the conventions in Shadwell, and that put everything
on a nice, respectable footing."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like tampering with the truth," said Colin.
"All the same, it has its advantages at times."  He
glanced mischievously at Nancy.  "In future, for
instance," he added, "it will be obviously necessary
that we should both address you by your Christian
name."
</p>

<p>
Nancy laughed.  "I never thought of that," she
said.  "It shows how unaccustomed I am to anything
in the nature of deception."
</p>

<p>
"You'll soon improve," returned Colin hopefully.
"It's wonderful what one can do after a month or
two with the medical profession."  He leaned
forward and selected another scone from the rapidly
dwindling pile.  "Now what about that theatre idea
of mine?" he continued.  "Can't you possibly manage
it, Mark?  I'll do the thing in a really generous
way&mdash;stand you dinner and seats and drive you both home
in the car afterward."
</p>

<p>
Mark shook his head reluctantly.  "I'd come like
a shot if I could," he replied, "but I've about twenty
prescriptions to make up and a dozen cases to
attend to."  He paused.  "All the same," he added,
"there's no earthly reason why you shouldn't take
Miss Seymour."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's not fair," protested Nancy.  "I can't
go off and leave you to do all the work."
</p>

<p>
Mark folded his arms.  "There's only one thing
I demand from my staff," he observed sternly, "and
that is complete and unquestioning obedience."  He
turned to Colin.  "What you both want," he added,
"is some fresh air and a little healthy amusement.
Why not have a run out into the country first?  It's
a fine evening, and you can get back up West in plenty
of time for the theatre."
</p>

<p>
"Now I call that a jolly bright notion!" exclaimed
Colin.  "What do you say, Cousin Nancy?"
</p>

<p>
"It sounds most tempting," agreed Nancy.  "All
the same, I think it would be horribly selfish.  I am
sure that if any one needs an evening off it's the doctor.
The last thing I promised Mrs. Ashton was not to
allow him to overwork."
</p>

<p>
"I am the head of the family," insisted Mark, "and
my orders are that you leave this house directly you've
finished tea.  Take her for a good long spin to start
with, Colin, give her a nice dinner, and then get seats
for something really frivolous and cheerful.  That's
my prescription, and I depend on you to see that it's
properly administered."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
With her eyes shining, and her cheeks flushed by
the wind, Nancy stepped out of the car on to the
comparatively deserted pavement of Whitcomb
Street.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she said with a faint sigh.  "That was simply
heavenly!"
</p>

<p>
Colin, who had jumped down first to open the door,
looked at her with an approving twinkle.
</p>

<p>
"Not bad, was it?" he agreed.  "We've only been
an hour and a half and we must have done at least
forty miles."
</p>

<p>
He glanced round in the direction of the Motor
Club, outside which they had alighted, and at the
same moment a broad-shouldered, seedy-looking
gentleman in a dilapidated ulster suddenly appeared out
of the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there you are, Joe," he continued.  "I want
you to look after the car for me.  We're dining and
going to a theatre, so I don't suppose I shall be back
until half-past eleven."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, sir," replied Joe comfortingly.
"You'll find me 'ere, no matter wot time you come."
</p>

<p>
"Now, where shall we make for?" inquired Colin,
turning to Nancy.  "Unless you've any particular
choice I suggest Romano's and the Vaudeville."
</p>

<p>
Nancy looked a little doubtful.  "I'm thinking of
my clothes," she explained.  "I'm not fit to go
anywhere really smart."
</p>

<p>
Colin studied her critically.  "Don't you believe
it," he said.  "You could walk straight into Paradise
without even tidying up."
</p>

<p>
He slipped half-a-crown into Joe's hand, and, taking
Nancy firmly by the elbow, piloted her across the
street in the direction of Leicester Square.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later, escorted by a sympathetic
manager, they were making their way toward a small
table in the balcony of the famous Strand restaurant.
</p>

<p>
"You order the dinner," said Nancy, as they took
their seats.  "I always enjoy things much more if
somebody else chooses them."
</p>

<p>
She leaned forward in her chair and looked down
contentedly at the animated scene below, while Colin
picked up the menu and studied it with becoming
gravity.
</p>

<p>
"I think we'll have a little clear soup to start with,"
he began, "followed by sole <i>à la bonne femme</i>, a roast
grouse, and iced meringues."  He paused.  "Do
you prefer champagne or sparkling Moselle?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Nancy frankly.  "I've never
tasted either of them."
</p>

<p>
"We'll have a half bottle of both then," said Colin.
"You can try them and see which you like best, and
I'll drink the other."
</p>

<p>
"By the way," he added, as the waiter hurried off
with the order, "have you been seeing anything of that
friend of yours, Major Fenton&mdash;the chap you introduced
me to in Jubilee Place?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment Nancy remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you ask me that?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know," said Colin casually.  "It just
happened to come into my head."
</p>

<p>
She paused again.  "He has been round at the
studio two or three evenings," she said slowly.  "As
a matter of fact, he was there last night."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose he's heard all about your new job?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "Doctor Gray&mdash;&mdash;" she began.
</p>

<p>
"Make it Colin," he interrupted.  "I can't call you
Nancy unless you back me up."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Colin, then&mdash;&mdash;"  She hesitated once more.
"There's something I think I ought to tell you about
Major Fenton, only&mdash;only it's horribly difficult for
me to know how to put it."
</p>

<p>
"Wait until you've had some dinner," he suggested.
"No one talks comfortably when they're half starving."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "No, now I've started I
think I'd better go on and get it over.  The first
time I saw Major Fenton after we met him together
he naturally asked me who you were.  I told him
what I knew about you and how we'd become
acquainted, and, although he didn't say much, he seemed
to think that I'd done wrong in asking you back to my
studio.  I suppose in a way he looks on himself as a
sort of guardian of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he does," said Colin gravely.  "People
who have lived a long time in hot climates often
suffer from hallucinations!"
</p>

<p>
"That didn't matter," continued Nancy, "but last
night when he came round he spoke about you again,
and this time he said something that made me really
angry&mdash;something that I'm perfectly sure isn't true."
</p>

<p>
Colin was leaning toward her, his gray eyes alight
with interest.
</p>

<p>
"What was it?" he demanded briefly.
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;well, he didn't put it quite definitely, but he
hinted that you were not the sort of man to make
a friend of; that you were leaving the hospital on
account of some dreadful scandal about one of the
nurses."
</p>

<p>
For a second Colin stared at her in blank amazement.
Then he suddenly broke into a peal of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, Nancy!" he exclaimed.  "If you'd
only seen 'em!"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't believe it, of course," she went on
hurriedly.  "I was certain he must be making some stupid
mistake."
</p>

<p>
Colin's lips tightened.  "I object to people making
mistakes of that sort about me," he observed rather
grimly.
</p>

<p>
Before Nancy could reply the waiter arrived with
the soup, followed a moment later by another, who
proceeded to uncork and pour out the wine.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't take it too seriously," she continued,
as soon as they were alone again.  "It was a detestable
thing of Major Fenton to say, but I don't think
he meant any real harm by it.  He explained that
he'd heard the story from somebody at his club, and
that he'd only repeated it to me because he felt that
it was his duty.  As I told you before, just because he
once knew my father, he seems to have some ridiculous
notion that he ought to look after me."
</p>

<p>
Colin, who had been sprinkling a little pepper into
his soup, looked up with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't let's waste our time discussing it any
more," he said cheerfully.  "It's just a silly lie, and,
anyway, there are lots of much pleasanter things to
talk about."  He raised his glass.  "I'm going to
propose the health of our old pal 'Ginger Dick.'  He
may have his faults, but, after all, if it wasn't for him
we shouldn't be sitting here now."
</p>

<p>
"That's true," agreed Nancy.  "Here's to 'Ginger
Dick."  She took a long sip and then set down
her glass.  "If that's sparkling Moselle," she added
thoughtfully, "I don't think I'll bother about tasting
the champagne."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
At about twenty minutes before midnight, faithful
to his pledged word, the reliable Joe slouched forward
out of the shadows and greeted them with a friendly
salute.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere we are, guv'nor," he announced.  "All ready
an' waitin' for yer, as the grave-digger said."
</p>

<p>
He opened the door of the car for Nancy, and,
making his way round to the front, succeeded after
two or three abortive efforts in starting up the engine.
</p>

<p>
"She's a bit cold, like meself," he continued.  "It's
bin freezin' crool 'ard all the evenin', an' I reckon we
both got a touch of it in our innards."
</p>

<p>
"You must follow it up with something hot," said
Colin, handing him another half-crown.  "Rum's the
best as long as you don't put too much water into it."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't likely to," replied Joe, with a grin.  "There's
quite enough o' that done before we gets the blarsted
stuff."
</p>

<p>
He pocketed the coin, and, closing the door after
them, stepped back on to the pavement.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, sir, an' thank yer kindly.  Good-night,
miss, an' Gawd bless yer both."
</p>

<p>
"I like Joe," said Nancy, as they slid out into the
glare and tumult of Piccadilly Circus.  "Is that his
profession&mdash;standing there all night looking after cars?"
</p>

<p>
"That's his present profession," replied Colin, "but
he's what you might call come down in the world.
Before he took to drink he used to be one of the best
middle-weight boxers in England."
</p>

<p>
Nancy opened her blue eyes to their fullest extent.
</p>

<p>
"A prize-fighter?" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Colin nodded.  "Joe Bates of Wapping.  One of
the gamest men who ever stepped into a ring."
</p>

<p>
"What made him take to drink?" inquired Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"I think it was chiefly the death of his wife," said
Colin.  "Anyhow, he went all to pieces about two
years ago, and ended up by getting run over in the
Fulham Road.  They brought him along to St. Christopher's,
where we managed to patch him up.  I felt
sorry for the poor chap, and when he came out I got
him that job at the Motor Club.  As people go, I
think he's by way of being rather grateful."
</p>

<p>
He swung clear of the traffic outside the Ritz, and
with a warning bark from the horn the little car
leaped forward down the long, brilliantly lit slope.
</p>

<p>
Turning up her coat collar with one hand, Nancy
settled herself contentedly in her seat.
</p>

<p>
"It's been a most exciting evening," she said.  "I've
enjoyed every single minute of it."
</p>

<p>
"So have I," agreed Colin with enthusiasm.  "What
do you say to repeating the experiment next week?"
</p>

<p>
"Only on one condition," replied Nancy.  "I've got
to take my turn in paying for dinner."
</p>

<p>
"But that's absurd!" protested Colin.  "I'm a
great deal richer than you are."
</p>

<p>
"No, you're not," was the indignant answer.  "Why,
I'm simply rolling in money.  I've no expenses now
except the rent of my studio, and Doctor Ashton pays
me at least twice what I'm worth."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe that," said Colin.  "Still, if you're
determined to be proud and ostentatious I suppose you
must have your way."
</p>

<p>
He swerved to the left behind St. George's Hospital,
and, cutting through the select precincts of
Belgrave Square, came out within a few yards of the
King's Road.  In another minute they were turning
the corner into Jubilee Place.
</p>

<p>
"Next week's a bargain, then," said Colin, as they
stood facing each other on the empty pavement.
"It's no good trying to fix a day at present; I'll just
ring up one morning and we'll arrange it over the
'phone."
</p>

<p>
Nancy nodded.  "That will be best," she said.
"You mustn't desert the Professor&mdash;not unless he can
manage all right without you."
</p>

<p>
She gave him her hand, which Colin squeezed in a
friendly grip.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Nancy," he said.  "Sleep well, and
when you see Mark, tell him that for once in his life
he actually prescribed the right treatment."
</p>

<p>
He waited until the front door had closed behind
her, and then, having lit himself a cigarette, climbed
back into the car, and started off again in the direction
of Campden Hill.
</p>

<p>
It was a few minutes after midnight when he let
himself in at the outer gate of the Red Lodge.  The
light was still burning in the hall, and, knowing from
experience that the Professor frequently continued his
work until the early hours of the morning, he walked
straight through to the laboratory and tapped lightly
on the door.
</p>

<p>
As he half expected, there was a creak of footsteps
inside, and the Professor himself, wearing an old
Jaeger dressing gown, appeared on the threshold.  At
the same moment a peculiarly acrid and unpleasant
smell drifted past him into the passage.
</p>

<p>
"So you've come back, eh?" he said in his queer,
high-pitched voice.  "I hope you enjoyed your evening?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't do badly," replied Colin.  "I went to
Shadwell, saw my friends, had a forty-mile run in the
car, and finished up with a dinner and a theatre."
</p>

<p>
The old man nodded grimly.  "It sounds rather an
exhausting form of recreation.  I should imagine that
after all that you must be quite ready for your bed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm not tired," said Colin, "not in the slightest.
If you've got anything on hand I should like to
come in and make myself useful."
</p>

<p>
"You'll do nothing of the sort," returned the
Professor.  "You will help yourself to a whisky and soda,
and then you will go straight upstairs to your room."
</p>

<p>
Colin hesitated.  "And how about you, sir?  Surely
you've done enough work for to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall be following you shortly," was the answer.
"I am only waiting to see the result of a small experiment."
</p>

<p>
He nodded a curt good-night, and, stepping back
again into the laboratory, closed the door behind him.
</p>

<p>
Dismissed in this unceremonious fashion, Colin
made his way into the dining room, where he found
a plate of sandwiches and a siphon set out ready for
him on a tray.  It was unthinkable that such an idea
could have occurred to the unaided intelligence of
Mrs. Ramsay, and, rather surprised at the Professor's
consideration, he proceeded to mix a drink, which he
carried with him up the staircase.
</p>

<p>
His room was situated on the first floor&mdash;a large,
comfortable apartment looking out toward the back.
It had been fitted up since his arrival with a gas stove,
and, having lighted this and placed his tumbler upon
the dressing table, he began in a leisurely fashion to
get ready for bed.
</p>

<p>
The chief subject that occupied his thoughts was the
revelation which Nancy had made to him at dinner.
What on earth had induced Major Fenton to concoct
that ridiculous story about a scandal at St. Christopher's
Hospital?  That it was an invention of his
own Colin felt certain, and no man would take the
responsibility of fathering such a lie unless he had
some particularly strong object in view.
</p>

<p>
Could he have fallen in love with Nancy himself?
If that were the case it would certainly supply a
possible motive.  Passion has a queer effect upon some
characters, and the mere thought of her making
friends with any one else might have filled him with
such furious resentment that he had clutched at the first
conceivable chance of breaking off their acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
It was a likely enough solution; and yet, somehow
or other, it left Colin unconvinced.  He had carried
away a very unfavourable impression of Nancy's
self-adopted guardian, but it was an impression that
declined to fit in with this otherwise plausible theory.
Unless his judgment were badly at fault, there was a
hard, calculating selfishness stamped upon every line
of the man's face.  People of that sort are not swept
off their feet by sudden outbursts of romantic jealousy,
nor&mdash;which was another and extremely significant
consideration&mdash;do they concern themselves unduly over
the welfare of a dead friend's offspring.
</p>

<p>
It was this latter point, indeed, which puzzled Colin
completely.  He felt convinced that Major Fenton
must have had some secret purpose in hunting Nancy
out and practically forcing his acquaintance upon her.
His story about a twenty-year-old friendship with her
father would have sounded well enough in a sentimental
novel, but having seen the gentleman for himself,
and having had an illuminating example of his
ideas of honour and fair play, Colin found the
explanation uncommonly difficult to swallow.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Inspector Marsden and his colleagues at
the Yard would be able to throw some light on the
problem.  It would be interesting at least to know a
little about the Major's career, and whether his past
record was at all in keeping with this sudden excursion
into philanthropy.
</p>

<p>
There was another possible source of information
in the person of Mr. Medwin.  The two men were
certainly acquainted, otherwise Fenton's photograph
would not have been adorning the mantelpiece in
Albert Terrace.  When he visited the house again he
could easily find an opportunity to make some casual
inquiry concerning the original, only it must be done in
a sufficiently tactful manner not to arouse the lawyer's
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
In any case, this alternative course could be
postponed until he had received the Inspector's report.
The odds were that, if there was really anything shady
in Fenton's history, Marsden would succeed in
unearthing it, and since Nancy seemed to be thoroughly
capable of looking after herself, another week's delay
was not likely to produce any tragical consequences.
</p>

<p>
With this consoling reflection Colin donned his
pyjamas, and, turning out the fire, clambered into
bed.  He was just in that pleasantly drowsy stage
when one feels half reluctant to fall asleep, and, lying
there with the light on, he allowed his thoughts to
drift back contentedly over the various details of his
two meetings with Nancy.
</p>

<p>
It was an agreeable occupation, and the longer he
indulged in it the more he began to realize what a very
necessary part of his life she had already become.
A kind of instinctive friendship seemed to have sprung
up between them at their first encounter, and, although
he had been unable to see her again until to-day, the
interval had certainly not succeeded in making the
faintest difference.
</p>

<p>
She was a girl in a thousand, there was no doubt
about that!  Mark evidently thought so, and, since
he compared all women with Mary, his standard was
about as high as any one could reasonably demand.
How enchantingly pretty she had looked as they had
sat opposite to each other at dinner.  He had only
to shut his eyes and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Hullo!  What the devil was that?
</p>

<p>
The sound had come from somewhere down below&mdash;a
queer, half-deadened noise, like the distant crash
of breaking glass.
</p>

<p>
In a second Colin was out of bed and had flung
open the door.  The lights were still burning exactly
as he had left them, and, striding to the banisters, he
peered over into the hall.  Nothing seemed to be
stirring; except for the steady ticking of the grandfather
clock the whole house was as silent as a tomb.
</p>

<p>
With a momentary feeling of relief he moved
toward the staircase.  It was probably only some
small accident; the Professor had most likely dropped
a tumbler or broken a retort, and in the stillness of the
night the noise had been naturally exaggerated.  All
the same, it would be just as well to have a look round.
</p>

<p>
Running lightly down in his bare feet, he crossed
the hall and knocked at the laboratory door.
</p>

<p>
"It's I&mdash;Gray," he called out.  "Anything wrong, sir?"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he turned the handle, and the next
moment he found himself standing in the open doorway,
staring blankly in front of him.
</p>

<p>
The room was empty.
</p>

<p>
For the first time a real sense of misgiving suddenly
took possession of him.  He wheeled sharply round,
and, hurrying back through the hall, rapped loudly
at the door of the study.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Carter," he shouted, "are you there?"
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.
</p>

<p>
He caught hold of the brass knob, only to make
another and still more ominous discovery.
Somebody had turned the key from inside.
</p>

<p>
With a quick breath he stepped back a couple of
paces, and then, hunching up his shoulder, hurled
himself against the panel.  Under the impact of
twelve stone and a few odd pounds the lock gave with
a splintering crash which echoed through the house.
The door swung open, and at the same moment the
shrill scream of a terrified woman rang out from the
top landing.
</p>

<p>
Clutching the broken woodwork to steady himself,
Colin fumbled for the switch.  His fingers closed
on it in the darkness and, half prepared as he was
for some horror, an involuntary cry broke from his
lips as the whole room flared suddenly into light.
</p>

<p>
Face upward, in the centre of the French windows,
lay the huddled figure of the Professor.  One arm was
twisted under him, and his white hair was dabbled in
a stream of blood which still oozed slowly from a
gaping wound in his forehead.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER FIVE
</h3>

<p>
At the sight of that hideous injury, all Colin's
professional training instinctively asserted itself.
Letting go the switch, he sprang forward, and, heedless
of the blood and broken glass, dropped down on one
knee beside the prostrate body.
</p>

<p>
It needed no medical knowledge to see that the
case was hopeless.  A terrific blow from some blunt
instrument had smashed the whole front of the skull,
and portions of the crushed and bleeding brain were
even now protruding from the wound.  Death must
have come with merciful abruptness&mdash;a sudden and
utter annihilation of every sense and feeling.
</p>

<p>
Almost dazed by the blast of fury that swept
through him, Colin stumbled to his feet.  He glanced
wildly round the room, and the broken French window,
one half of which was standing open, immediately
caught his eye.  Since the door had been locked
from inside, it was the only way by which the murderer
could have escaped.  He had evidently darted through
into the garden with the intention of climbing the wall,
and, moved by a desperate hope, Colin stepped across
the dead body and ran out on to the lawn.  A flood
of moonlight, streaming in through the bare trees, lit
up the whole desolate expanse of grass and shrubs.
Everything was perfectly still, and, except for the
faint rumbling of a cart in the distance, the entire
neighbourhood seemed to be plunged in absolute silence.
</p>

<p>
He was listening intently, with his eyes on the black
line of bushes opposite, when a slight noise in the
room behind attracted his attention.  He turned
round instantly, and through the window he caught
sight of the panic-stricken figure of Mrs. Ramsay
peering in at the open doorway.
</p>

<p>
As he moved forward into the light she uttered a
stifled scream.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be frightened," he said quickly.  "It's
I&mdash;Doctor Gray."
</p>

<p>
Clutching at her dressing-gown with one hand, she
pointed a trembling finger toward the body.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my Gawd, sir," she gasped, "what is it?
What's been happening?"
</p>

<p>
Colin stood in the window, his face white and set.
</p>

<p>
"The Professor has been murdered," he said.
</p>

<p>
She stared at him for a moment, as though his words
conveyed no meaning; then with a pitiful sound, like
the whimpering of a beaten dog, she staggered back
against the wall.
</p>

<p>
Colin strode forward and took her by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"You must pull yourself together," he said curtly.
"This is no time for hysterics.  I want your
help&mdash;now&mdash;at once."
</p>

<p>
As he expected, his almost brutal words had the
desired result.  She stopped crying, and once more
her terrified glance travelled round in the direction of
the dead man.
</p>

<p>
"Who&mdash;who killed him?"
</p>

<p>
Colin shook his head.  "I don't know.  When I
came down the study door was locked from inside.
I broke it open and found him lying here&mdash;like this."
</p>

<p>
"It must have been the same man," she whispered;
"the one who tried to burgle his desk."  She caught
hold of Colin's sleeve, and looked up imploringly into
his face.  "Oh, sir, can't nothing be done?  Isn't
there&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am going to telephone to the police.  While I'm
doing it I want you to stand outside in the hall, so that
you can see into the room.  If you hear the smallest
sound or movement in the garden call to me at once."
</p>

<p>
She gazed fearfully toward the broken window.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he's out there, sir, hiding in the
bushes?"
</p>

<p>
"I think he's a quarter of a mile away by this time.
All the same, until the police arrive the room mustn't
be left unwatched for a single moment."
</p>

<p>
He waited until she had obeyed his instructions,
and then, with a final glance round, walked swiftly
down the passage and took off the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Get me on to Scotland Yard as soon as possible,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
There was a note of urgency in his demand which
must have carried conviction even to the mind of the
clerk, for in something less than ten seconds the reply
came.
</p>

<p>
"Scotland Yard speaking.  Who's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Colin Gray.  Can you tell me if Inspector
Marsden is still there?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so.  Hold on a minute and I'll find out."
</p>

<p>
A pause followed.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" exclaimed a voice.  "I'm Marsden.  What's
the matter, doctor?  I didn't expect to hear from
you again at this time of night."
</p>

<p>
"It's a bad business," said Colin quietly.  "I'm
speaking from the Red Lodge, Campden Hill.  I have
just found Professor Carter lying dead in his study."
</p>

<p>
"Dead!" came the sharp rejoinder.  "How did he
die?"
</p>

<p>
"He has been murdered."
</p>

<p>
He heard a sudden exclamation at the other end of
the wire.
</p>

<p>
"Murdered!  Good God, doctor!  Are you certain
of what you're saying?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly certain.  He has been murdered by some
man who broke into the house after I had gone to bed.
The whole front of his skull has been smashed to
pieces."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief silence, followed by a few indistinct
words, as though Marsden had turned round and
was addressing someone else.  Then his voice came
again, clear and peremptory.
</p>

<p>
"When did this happen?"
</p>

<p>
"About six or seven minutes ago."
</p>

<p>
"How did the man escape?"
</p>

<p>
"I think he ran out into the garden and climbed over
the wall."
</p>

<p>
"Is there any one else in the house besides you?"
</p>

<p>
"There are two old servants.  One of them is
watching the room now."
</p>

<p>
"You had better go back yourself, and stop there
until we arrive.  Leave everything exactly as you
found it.  Don't disturb the body and don't touch
or move a single object.  We shall be with you in a
quarter of an hour.  Do you quite understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite," said Colin.
</p>

<p>
He hung up the receiver as the detective rang off,
and, shivering slightly from the cold, made his way
back to where he had left the housekeeper.
</p>

<p>
"They're coming down almost at once," he said.
"I'll wait here and let them in."
</p>

<p>
She moved back, as though glad to escape from the
sight of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'd better go up and get your dressing
gown," she replied.  "You'll catch your death
standing about like that with nothing on."
</p>

<p>
Colin nodded gratefully.  "You might fetch me
some slippers, too, while you're about it," he said.
"You'll find a pair alongside the bed.  I turned out
in such a hurry I forgot to put them on."
</p>

<p>
With trembling steps and holding tightly to the
banisters, Mrs. Ramsay slowly ascended the staircase.
She returned in a few minutes carrying the desired
articles, and, stepping forward to meet her, Colin took
them from her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks so much," he exclaimed.  "Now I think
the best thing you can do is to get back to your room.
I expect the police will want to see you when they
come, but until then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ramsay shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't be no use, sir.  I couldn't close my
eyes, not if you was to offer me a thousand pounds."  She
turned again toward the stairs.  "Besides, there's
Mrs. Wilson&mdash;the cook, you know, sir.  I've got to
go and look after her."
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?  Is she ill?" demanded Colin.
</p>

<p>
"I heard her screaming," was the answer.  "I
shouldn't wonder if anything had happened, what with
being woke up sudden and her having a weak heart."
</p>

<p>
"People don't often die from shock," said Colin.
"Take her up a drop of brandy out of the dining room,
and you had better have a little yourself at the same
time."
</p>

<p>
He thrust his feet into the slippers, and, putting on
his dressing gown, reentered the study.
</p>

<p>
Unlike most people whose ideas on the subject are
drawn chiefly from sensational novels, Colin knew
that the surest way of assisting a criminal was for
some well-meaning amateur to conduct a few preliminary
investigations before the arrival of the police.
During his four years at the hospital he had twice been
called upon to give evidence in cases of murder, and
the experience had convinced him that it was only
when a properly qualified detective was first in the
field that any really valuable clues were likely to be
forthcoming.  Marsden's urgent instructions over the
telephone had therefore been unnecessary; even
without them he would certainly have waited for the
Inspector's appearance before attempting any further
interference with the existing condition of the room.
</p>

<p>
He walked across to where the Professor was lying
and looked down again at the body.  The sight filled
him with a mingled grief and anger that were almost
unbearable.  He had revered the dead man with all
the ardour of a disciple, and, in addition to this
lifelong homage, their close intimacy during the last
few weeks had produced other and still stronger ties.
In spite of the old scientist's rather dictatorial
manner, his attitude throughout had been so
extraordinarily kind and generous that a very real if
half-unconscious affection for him had gradually sprung
up in Colin's heart.  The thought that the murder
had been committed while he was actually in the house
only increased the horror and bitterness of the whole
affair.  No excuses could alter his feeling that he had
failed miserably&mdash;failed in the very duty for which
he had been selected and employed.
</p>

<p>
Self-reproaches, however, were of little use now,
and with a tremendous effort he wrenched his mind
back to the immediate problem that confronted it.
Why, in God's name, should any one have wished to
kill the Professor, and how had it come about that
the latter's body was lying where it did?  In order
to reach the study from the laboratory one had to
pass through the whole length of the hall.  Colin's
hearing was particularly acute, and he felt positive
that the creak of footsteps or the opening or shutting
of a door would instantly have attracted his attention.
Nothing of the sort had happened.  Until that one
crash of breaking glass the whole house had been
absolutely silent.
</p>

<p>
His eyes fell upon the damaged lock, and another
question suddenly presented itself.  Who had been
responsible for turning the key?  Surely it could not
have been the Professor.  If he had entered the room
expecting to find it empty, what conceivable reason
could he have had for fastening himself in?  If, on
the other hand, he had entertained even the remotest
suspicion that somebody was hiding on the premises,
he would certainly have come upstairs before attempting
to approach the study.
</p>

<p>
It seemed more likely that the murderer had locked
the door after committing the crime, so that he might
have a better chance of making his escape.  There
was a coolness about the proceeding which suggested
that he was fully aware of Colin's presence in the
house, and a conviction that the whole thing had been
planned and carried out with the most cold-blooded
deliberation forced itself gradually upon the young
surgeon's mind.
</p>

<p>
Had Mrs. Ramsay been right?  Was it the same
man who had ransacked the Professor's desk?
</p>

<p>
If it were so&mdash;and all the circumstances seemed to
point to that conclusion&mdash;burglary and not murder
had probably been the real object of his visit.  There
was evidently something in the place, some document
or paper, of which he was desperately anxious to
obtain possession.  Having failed to find it at his
first attempt, he had apparently returned to the house
a second time in order to make another and more
exhaustive search.
</p>

<p>
By some fatal chance the Professor must have taken
it into his head to enter the study just after the
intruder had succeeded in gaining admittance.  On
finding the window open he had naturally stepped forward
to close it, only to receive a murderous blow out of
the darkness, which had sent him crashing into the
glass.
</p>

<p>
The one fact which refused to fit in with this theory
was the entire absence of any sound right up to the
actual moment of the crime.  There must, of course,
be some explanation, and Colin was puzzling his brains
in a vain attempt to discover it when the loud peal
of a bell suddenly jangled out from the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Just pausing to gather his dressing gown about him,
he hurried down the passageway to the outer door,
which he unfastened and opened.  A large car was
drawn up in the roadway, and five men, two of them
uniformed constables, were standing in a group on the
pavement.
</p>

<p>
Inspector Marsden, who was in the centre, immediately
came forward.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what's happened, doctor?" he inquired
curtly.  "Anything fresh to report?"
</p>

<p>
Colin shook his head.  "Only what I told you over
the telephone," he replied.  "The Professor is dead,
and the man who murdered him has escaped."
</p>

<p>
"That's enough to go on with, anyhow," returned
the detective.  "Jackson, you and Roberts stop here
for the present.  If any one attempts to leave the
house arrest them at once."
</p>

<p>
With an obedient salute the two constables fell back,
and, followed by his other companions, Marsden
mounted the steps.
</p>

<p>
"This is Doctor Sinclair, our divisional surgeon," he
announced.  "He tells me that he has already had the
pleasure of meeting you."
</p>

<p>
Colin shook hands with a tall, gray-bearded man,
whose face seemed vaguely familiar.
</p>

<p>
"And this," continued the Inspector, "is Detective
Sergeant Humphries, of the Finger Print Department.
Now I think the first thing we'll do is to go in and
have a look at the body.  I'll take your statement
as soon as the doctor has finished his examination."
</p>

<p>
Without offering any comment, Colin conducted
them down the corridor, and, leading the way across
the hall, brought them to the door of the study.
</p>

<p>
Marsden halted in the entrance, and stood staring
silently at the tragic spectacle in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"You followed my instructions?" he asked.  "Everything
is exactly as you found it!"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," said Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll ask you two gentlemen to wait here
for a moment.  There's just one point I should like
to make certain about before any one touches the
body."
</p>

<p>
He pulled out a notebook from his inside pocket,
and, beckoning to his colleague stepped forward into
the room.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Sinclair moved across to where Colin was
standing.
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose you remember me," he said, "but
I called in at St. Christopher's last year in connection
with one of your cases."  He nodded toward the
two detectives, both of whom were kneeling down beside
the dead man.  "This is a very terrible business,"
he added.  "I was horrified when I heard that it was
Professor Carter."
</p>

<p>
Colin, whose mind was in no state for conversation,
made an effort to collect his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Did you know him personally?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The surgeon shook his head.  "No," he replied.
"Like everyone else, I was a great admirer of his
work, but I never had the honour of being introduced
to him.  The police tell me that you were acting as
his resident assistant."
</p>

<p>
"I came here straight from the hospital," said
Colin.  "I had been with him for nearly a month."
</p>

<p>
"It seems such a particularly brutal and senseless
crime," continued the other, after a short pause.
"One would think that even the most callous ruffian
would hesitate about striking down an old man of over
eighty."  He glanced at Colin's dressing gown.  "I
gather that the murderer broke into the house after
you had gone to bed?"
</p>

<p>
Colin was about to answer when the Inspector got
up suddenly and turned toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"We've seen all we want to for the present, doctor.
Perhaps you'll be good enough to have a look at the
body now, and let's hear your opinion?"
</p>

<p>
The surgeon hurried forward, and, following him
slowly into the room, Colin seated himself on the
corner of the sofa.  From this position he was able
to watch the proceedings of all three of his
companions, none of whom for the moment betrayed any
desire to interrogate him further.  Doctor Sinclair,
after taking off his coat, became wholly absorbed in
his professional duties.  Marsden appeared to be busy
making notes, while the sergeant, who had produced
an electric torch and a large magnifying glass, stepped
down into the garden and began a minute examination
of the still open French window.
</p>

<p>
At last, after a lapse of several minutes, the surgeon
rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"It is a clear case of deliberate murder," he said
slowly.  "The Professor was struck on the temple by
some blunt weapon&mdash;probably a jemmy.  There is
no doubt that he was killed instantly.  I should think
he has been dead for about twenty minutes."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector turned to Colin.  "You were the
first to view the body," he remarked.  "Is there
anything in the doctor's report with which you are not in
agreement?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," replied Colin.  "I came to the same
conclusion myself directly I examined the wound."
</p>

<p>
Marsden pulled a chair up to the table, and the
sergeant, who had been listening from the window,
stepped forward and joined him.
</p>

<p>
"I want the full facts now, Doctor Gray," he said
brusquely.  "Tell us in your own words exactly what
happened from the moment you returned to the
house."
</p>

<p>
Amid a profound silence, broken only by the occasional
scratching of the Inspector's pencil, Colin proceeded
to relate his story.  Starting with his talk
to the Professor at the laboratory door, he went on
step by step to describe the whole of his subsequent
experiences right up to the arrival of his present
companions.  He kept strictly to the bare facts, making
no attempt to explain his own views, and all three of
his audience listened to him with an absorbed interest,
which showed itself plainly in their faces.
</p>

<p>
It was only when he had quite finished that the
Inspector offered his first comment.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I wish everyone could make a statement
like that," he said approvingly.  "It would save us a
lot of trouble in the course of the year."  He leaned
forward, and ran his eye over the various notes which
he had jotted down while Colin was speaking.  "This
other burglary that the housekeeper referred to," he
inquired; "when did that take place?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it was about three months ago," said
Colin, after a moment's reflection.  "I wasn't here at
the time; in fact, there was no one else in the house
except Mrs. Ramsay and the cook.  That was really
the chief reason why the Professor decided to engage
an assistant."
</p>

<p>
"Why weren't the police notified?" demanded the
Inspector.  "There was certainly no report sent in to
the Yard."
</p>

<p>
"The Professor declared that he didn't want to
waste his time.  He was a very busy man, and as nothing
appeared to have been stolen he decided to let the
whole matter drop."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing stolen!" repeated Marsden, raising his
eyebrows.  "Are you perfectly certain about that?"
</p>

<p>
"It's what he told me, anyhow," replied Colin.
"According to him, the only damage they did was to
smash open his desk and search his papers."
</p>

<p>
Both men glanced across the room in the direction
of the oak bureau.
</p>

<p>
"Is that the desk?" inquired the Sergeant.
</p>

<p>
Colin nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Had he any idea what they were after?"
</p>

<p>
"Not the slightest.  All his papers which are of
any scientific value are kept in the laboratory.  I
believe he had some money and valuables in the safe, but
they seem to have left that entirely alone."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief silence, and then, without
saying anything, the Sergeant got up from his chair
and walked over toward the two pieces of furniture
in question.  Marsden remained seated, his
keen blue eyes fixed thoughtfully upon Colin's
face.
</p>

<p>
"What's your opinion, doctor?" he asked at last.
</p>

<p>
"I am inclined to agree with Mrs. Ramsay," said
Colin.  "I think it was the same man who broke into
the house before.  He is evidently searching for some
particular paper or document, and as he couldn't find
it in the desk he came back a second time to try and
open the safe.  On his first visit he probably hadn't
got the necessary tools with him."
</p>

<p>
"And how about the murder?"
</p>

<p>
Colin hesitated.  "There's one thing I don't
understand," he frankly admitted.  "I left the Professor
working in the laboratory, and it's a mystery to me
how he managed to reach the study without my
hearing him.  I was awake the whole time, and I can
swear that there wasn't a sound."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can explain that to you," said the Inspector.
"Mr. Carter didn't cross the hall; he entered the room
by the window."
</p>

<p>
With a sudden exclamation Colin started to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, what an idiot I am!" he exclaimed.  "I
never thought of that.  Of course, there's a side door
from the laboratory into the garden."
</p>

<p>
"I imagined that there must be," said Marsden,
"and I haven't the least doubt that we shall find it
unlocked."  He got up from his chair and glanced at
the police surgeon, who was standing by himself in
front of the fire.  "I don't think we need keep you
any longer, Doctor Sinclair," he added.  "I'll let you
know what time we fix for the P.M. as soon as I've
seen Ashford."
</p>

<p>
The surgeon, who seemed ready enough to depart,
picked up his hat and coat.
</p>

<p>
"You can tell him to 'phone me at my house," he
replied.  "I shall be there till midday for certain."
</p>

<p>
He nodded a general good-night, and, accepting
Colin's offer to escort him to the front door, accompanied
the latter through the hall and down the outer
corridor.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be bound to come across each other
again during the next few days," he said as they shook
hands.  "I only hope that when all this is over we
shall have the pleasure of meeting under less
distressing circumstances."
</p>

<p>
Colin returned some more or less suitably polite
rejoinder, and, shutting the door, made his way back
to the study.
</p>

<p>
He found the two detectives standing in front of the
safe, the sergeant stooping down and apparently
engaged in some experiment with the lock.
</p>

<p>
Marsden looked round at his entrance.
</p>

<p>
"We'll leave Humphries to finish up here," he said.
"I want you to take me to the laboratory; and afterward,
if you'll call down the servants, I'd like to have
a few minutes' conversation with both of them."
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose you'll get much out of the cook,"
said Colin doubtfully.  "According to Mrs. Ramsay,
she's collapsed for the night."
</p>

<p>
"She'll talk all right," was the somewhat cynical
answer.  "Women can always pull themselves together
if there's a chance of using their tongues."
</p>

<p>
He stepped forward briskly, and, following Colin
to the back of the house, turned down the side passage
which led to the laboratory.
</p>

<p>
The door of the latter apartment was still open,
and at the sight of the big, brilliantly lit interior he
pulled up with an exclamation of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" he remarked.  "I'd no idea it was such
a size.  The old man must have been pretty well off
if he could afford to run up places like this."
</p>

<p>
He glanced round the room as though in search
of the additional exit, and, without waiting for his
question, Colin pointed toward a high screen which
jutted out at right angles from the wall.
</p>

<p>
"It's behind there," he explained.  "I never thought
of looking to see if it was open.  The Professor told
me that he only used it in summer time."
</p>

<p>
"He used it to-night," was the detective's reply.
"If he hadn't he would probably be alive now."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he descended the steps, and, with Colin
in close attendance, strode confidently toward the
spot.  They came to a halt in front of a small oak
door, flush with the wall, and, catching hold of the
handle, Marsden gave it a sharp turn.  The next
moment a gust of cold wind was blowing in their
faces, and they were staring across the lawn in the
direction of the study windows, from which a flood
of yellow light streamed out into the darkness of the
garden.
</p>

<p>
It was the Inspector who first broke the silence.
"That's clear enough as far as it goes," he observed.
"The question is, Why did he open the door at one
o'clock in the morning?"
</p>

<p>
A possible explanation suddenly occurred to Colin.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't wonder if he wanted to let in a little
fresh air.  He'd been making an experiment, and
there was a horrible smell in the room when I spoke
to him at the doorway."
</p>

<p>
"You've got it," was Marsden's laconic answer.
He pulled out an electric torch, a duplicate of the
sergeant's, and allowed the light to play backward
and forward over the patch of gravel outside.  "I
don't suppose there will be any footprints," he
continued.  "It's been freezing too infernally hard for
that, and, in any case, we shall only do more harm
than good by trampling all over the place in the dark."  He
switched off the torch, and closing and locking the
door, put away the key in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"We'll get back now," he added, "and if you'll give
me a hand I think we'll move the Professor's body into
his own bedroom.  When we've done that you can call
down the servants."
</p>

<p>
They returned to the study, where they found Humphries
still examining the safe, and after the Inspector
had exchanged a few words with his subordinate, he
and Colin set about their task.
</p>

<p>
Lifting the frail, bloodstained figure between them,
they carried it slowly up the staircase as far as the
first landing.  The Professor's room was situated
right at the end of the corridor, a large, sparsely
furnished apartment with an old-fashioned four-poster
in the farther corner.  They laid their burden on the
bed, and Marsden stood up, cap in hand, while Colin
sponged away the blood and covered over the body
with a clean sheet.
</p>

<p>
"It's a wretched sort of ending to a life like his,"
said the detective, with an unexpected touch of feeling.
"One of the greatest scholars in the world, so they tell
me; and look at him now&mdash;knocked on the head and
done for, just like any common drunk in a street
fight!"  He paused.  "I'm not a rich man," he added,
"but I'd give a couple of months' pay to put a rope
round the neck of the party who did this."
</p>

<p>
He walked to the door, and, replacing his cap,
glanced up at the landing above.
</p>

<p>
"You might give the servants a call now, doctor,"
he said.  "Don't frighten 'em; just say that if they
feel up to it I'd like to have a nice friendly little chat
in the study."  He dived into his pocket and once
more pulled out his notebook.  "By the way, can
you tell me the name and address of the Professor's
solicitor?  We shall have to get hold of him the first
thing in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"It's a Mr. Medwin," said Colin.  "He lives close
by here in Albert Terrace, but I'm hanged if I can
remember his number."
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter," returned Marsden.  "I can
easily look him up in the telephone directory."
</p>

<p>
He jotted down the name, and, replacing the book
in his pocket, laid his hand on Colin's arm.
</p>

<p>
"There'll be no need for you to stay up any longer,"
he said.  "Both Humphries and I have got plenty to
keep us busy until breakfast time.  You turn in and
get some sleep as soon as you've brought down the
servants."
</p>

<p>
Colin, who was beginning to feel distinctly weary,
contented himself with a nod.
</p>

<p>
"You'll know where to find me," he said, pointing
to his room.  "If there's anything you happen to want
just give me a call."
</p>

<p>
He left his companion at the end of the passage
and mounted the second flight, which led up to the
servants' quarters.  Somewhat to his surprise, he
found Mrs. Ramsay and the cook, both fully dressed,
standing on the small landing at the head of the
stairs.
</p>

<p>
"We couldn't stop in bed," explained the former,
"not after we heard the bell ring.  Oh, sir, what do
the police say?  Have they&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The Inspector wants to have a few minutes' talk
with both of you," he said.  "Of course, if Mrs. Wilson
doesn't feel well enough&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The cook drew herself up with a suggestion of
injured pride.
</p>

<p>
"I know my duty, sir," she remarked.  "If the
police wishes for my hevidence they shall have it heven
if I drop dead on the carpet, the same as my poor
mother did before me."
</p>

<p>
There being apparently nothing further to be said,
Colin conducted his charges as far as the study, where
he found the two detectives waiting to receive them.
He remained just long enough to make the necessary
introductions, and then, availing himself of Marsden's
suggestion, returned upstairs again to his own room.
</p>

<p>
Now that his services were no longer needed an
irresistible reaction had suddenly set in.  He felt tired
out in mind and body, and, scarcely conscious of anything
but an intense desire for sleep, he threw off his
dressing gown, and, for the second time that evening,
clambered thankfully into bed.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him as though he had scarcely laid his
head upon the pillow when he was abruptly aroused
by a touch on the shoulder.  He sat up with a start,
and, rubbing his eyes, perceived a burly and familiar
figure standing beside him in the gloom.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Inspector!" he exclaimed.  "What's the
matter?  Anything wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"Only the time," returned his visitor.  "It's just
gone eight, and as we're expecting Mr. Medwin at nine
I thought I'd better give you a knock-up."
</p>

<p>
With rather a rueful laugh Colin threw back the
clothes.
</p>

<p>
"How about breakfast?" he inquired.  "Have you
made any arrangements?"
</p>

<p>
"The cook's on the job," was the encouraging answer.
"I was careful to keep on the right side of her
last night, and she's promised us a dish of eggs and
bacon at a quarter past."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there," said Colin, thrusting a leg over the
side.  "How did you and the sergeant get on after
I'd gone to bed?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, we haven't altogether wasted our time," said
Marsden, turning toward the door.  "I won't hang
about in your way now, however.  You shall have the
news&mdash;such as it is&mdash;while we're waiting for the
solicitor."
</p>

<p>
He disappeared with a friendly nod, and, after
indulging in a cold tub and a somewhat hasty toilet,
Colin followed him downstairs to the dining room.
</p>

<p>
His arrival synchronized almost exactly with that
of Mrs. Ramsay, who appeared from the kitchen carrying
a well-laden tray.  She arranged the contents on
the breakfast table, which was already set out, at the
same time expressing an apologetic hope that if there
were any shortcomings they might be attributed to the
natural agitation of herself and the cook.  She then
retired, and with an air of businesslike alacrity the two
detectives drew up their chairs.
</p>

<p>
"This will just suit my complaint," observed Marsden,
uncovering the eggs and bacon.  "I was never a
believer in working on an empty stomach, and I
reckon Humphries here is pretty much of the same
opinion."
</p>

<p>
"There were some sandwiches and whisky on the
sideboard last night," said Colin.  "I ought to have
told you before I went to bed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we found them all right," returned Marsden
with a smile.  "And, for the matter of that, some
very excellent cigars, too."  He helped his companions
to a generous portion each, and transferred the
remainder to his own plate.  "I only wish," he added
grimly, "that we'd been equally successful in our
professional discoveries."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any clue at all?" asked Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Depends on what you call a clue," was the answer.
"I can tell you one thing for a certainty.  Whoever
broke into the house was an old hand at the game,
and, what's more, a chap who knew his job from A
to Z."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you think that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're not likely to find an amateur burglar
who can cut out a pane of glass without making a
sound, nor yet one who wears gloves so as to hide his
finger prints.  Besides, no one but an expert cracksman
could possibly have forced the lock of the safe."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know it was forced," said Colin.
</p>

<p>
"One bolt had gone, anyhow; and a very neat bit of
work it was, too, eh, Humphries?"
</p>

<p>
The sergeant, whose mouth was full, confined himself
to an affirmative grunt.
</p>

<p>
"That rather knocks the bottom out of my theory,"
said Colin, after a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"It simplifies things a good deal from our point
of view," returned the Inspector.  "Directly we can
get a crime into a particular class we're half way
toward finding the man who did it.  You see, there
are never more than a certain number of skilled burglars
out of prison, and it's the Yard's business to keep
a pretty close eye on what they're up to.  Roughly
speaking, a case like this narrows itself down to about
twenty or thirty likely parties.  By to-night they'll all
have been put through it, and if there's a single one
who can't account exactly for what he was doing
he'll&mdash;well, he'll be what the newspapers call 'detained for
further inquiries.'
</p>

<p>
"Do you think it was the same man who broke in
before?" asked Colin.
</p>

<p>
Marsden looked doubtful.  "It may be, of course,
and if that's so there's probably more in the case than
appears on the surface.  A man like the Professor
might very well have had papers and secrets that
certain people were anxious to get hold of, and it's
quite on the cards that they might have taken in a
professional thief to do their dirty work for them.
The trouble is that at present we know practically
nothing about his private life."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help you there," said Colin.  "I believe
that Mr. Medwin was the only person who was at all
in his confidence."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Medwin will be able to answer for
himself in a few minutes.  Our next best hope is to
get on to the track of this old manservant Kennedy.
He seems to have been with the Professor for about
forty years, so if he's still alive he might be able to
give us some useful information."
</p>

<p>
"I expect Mrs. Ramsay or the cook could let you
have his address."
</p>

<p>
"I asked them last night, but neither of them has
the least notion where he is.  From the way they
spoke I gather that there was precious little love lost
between them.  However, he will probably show up
as soon as he reads about the murder, and, if not,
we oughtn't to have much difficulty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A ring at the front door bell interrupted his words,
and, glancing at the clock, he gulped down the
remainder of his tea.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if this is our man," he added.  "You
don't often find a solicitor ahead of his time."  He
turned to Colin as Mrs. Ramsay's steps were heard
crossing the hall.  "Just a word of caution, doctor.
He knows nothing about the murder yet, and
I've told the old lady to keep her tongue quiet
while she's showing him in.  Leave me to break the
news if you will; I've a fancy to see how he takes
it."
</p>

<p>
Colin's only reply was a nod, and the three of
them sat in silence until the door opened and
Mrs. Ramsay appeared on the threshold, with the massive
form of Mr. Medwin looming up behind her.
</p>

<p>
The solicitor, who was wearing a frock-coat and
carrying a top hat in his hand, took a couple of paces
forward.  Then with an air of surprise he came to a
sudden halt.
</p>

<p>
The Inspector rose instantly.
</p>

<p>
"Let me introduce myself, Mr. Medwin.  I am
Inspector Marsden, of Scotland Yard."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin bowed, his close-set eyes travelling
swiftly over the other occupants of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning," he said, in that peculiarly
suave voice of his.  "May I inquire what all this
signifies?"
</p>

<p>
"Professor Carter has been murdered."
</p>

<p>
Marsden's answer came with startling bluntness,
and there could be no question as to the effect that
it produced.  An expression of incredulous amazement
flashed across the big man's face, and for a moment
he stood gripping his hat and staring blankly at
the speaker.
</p>

<p>
"Murdered?" he exclaimed at last.  "Impossible!
There must be some mistake."
</p>

<p>
"It's not the sort of thing that lends itself to
mistakes," returned the detective.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin drew in a long breath, and Colin, who
was watching intently, saw that he was making a
tremendous effort to recover his self-control.
</p>

<p>
"I think I had better sit down for a moment," he
said slowly.
</p>

<p>
He moved forward, and, laying his hat on the
corner of the table, sank into the vacant chair from
which Marsden had just arisen.
</p>

<p>
"You must excuse me," he continued.  "I feel half
stunned at this appalling news.  The Professor was
one of my most valued friends."  He moistened his
lips and glanced up suddenly at the detective.  "When
did it happen?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Last night," was the reply, "or, to be more exact,
about a quarter to one this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Why wasn't I sent for before?"
</p>

<p>
Marsden stroked his moustache, and eyed the other
with a kind of dispassionate interest.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Medwin, I appreciate the importance of
your testimony, but as I happen to be responsible for
this case you must permit me to conduct my investigation
in the way that I consider best."
</p>

<p>
Instead of betraying any resentment at the snub,
the solicitor merely nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," he assented readily.  "Your first step
would naturally be to go into all the circumstances
of the murder, and I was forgetting for a moment
what a great deal of work it must have entailed."  He
paused.  "Have you made any discoveries?" he
asked.  "Anything that could possibly be described as
a clue?"
</p>

<p>
"Several," replied Marsden.  "But I think it will
save time if I give you the full details straight away.
There are several peculiar features about the affair,
and it's not much use discussing them until you are in
possession of the facts."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin folded his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Just exactly as you prefer," he remarked.  "Please
consider me entirely at your service."
</p>

<p>
Without wasting any more words Marsden entered
upon a brief description of everything that had taken
place from the moment when Colin had returned to
the house.  The curt and matter-of-fact fashion in
which he told his story seemed somehow or other to
heighten its dramatic horror, and, in spite of the
solicitor's expressionless face, it was easy to see the
strained attention with which he was following every
word.  Once or twice he seemed to be on the point of
asking a question, but on each occasion he apparently
changed his mind at the last moment, as though
unwilling to interrupt the narrative.
</p>

<p>
"As far as I can see at present," concluded Marsden,
"there are two probable lines of inquiry, both of
which I propose to follow up.  Either it was an
ordinary case of burglary, or else the thief was after
some particular object that he believed to be hidden
in the study.  With regard to the actual murder,
I am inclined to think that it was more or less of an
accident.  The silly fool got rattled when the old man
came in at the window, and smashed his head in before
he realized what he was doing.  He has probably
been cursing himself ever since."
</p>

<p>
"I should say that your first suggestion was the
right one," remarked Mr. Medwin.  "An old-fashioned
house like this, shut away from the road,
is exactly the sort of place that a professional burglar
would select.  It's very improbable there's anything
more in it than that&mdash;a sordid attempt at house-breaking,
ending up in a brutal and bloody murder."
</p>

<p>
"Well," returned Marsden slowly, "I'm not altogether
satisfied on the point.  Take the question of
this previous attempt.  Granting it was the same man,
why did he content himself with merely examining the
desk?"
</p>

<p>
The lawyer glanced swiftly in the direction of Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Is that what the Professor told you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Colin nodded.
</p>

<p>
"He said the same thing to me," continued the
other, "but I remember wondering at the time
whether his statement could really be trusted.  Like
so many gifted men, he was curiously careless in the
matter of money.  It's quite possible that he may have
had a bundle of notes in some drawer that he
remembered nothing about."
</p>

<p>
"And you think that, having whetted his appetite,
the thief came back for more?"
</p>

<p>
Marsden put the question almost casually.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin spread out his hands.  "Surely it's a
more likely theory than to imagine the existence of
some mysterious object that nobody has ever heard
of?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that if the Professor had had any
specially valuable paper or secret in his possession he
would probably have mentioned the fact?  I gather
that you were entirely in his confidence?"
</p>

<p>
"Entirely, as far as his business arrangements were
concerned."
</p>

<p>
"And how about his private affairs?"
</p>

<p>
The solicitor paused.  "I am as much in the dark
as you are with regard to them.  On anything that
concerned himself Mr. Carter was one of the most
reticent men who ever lived."
</p>

<p>
"So I understand from Dr. Gray," returned the
Inspector.  "All the same, we shall have to look into
the matter, and I should think the easiest way of
doing it would be to get in touch with his old servant,
Kennedy.  Do you happen to know where he can be
found?"
</p>

<p>
Colin, who was watching closely, thought that he
detected a faint change of expression in the solicitor's
face.  If so, it passed away instantly.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't any idea," was the reply.  "I am afraid
it's very likely that he's dead.  He was partly paralyzed
when he left the Professor's service, and I don't
imagine he would have lasted for more than a few
months."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector walked to the window and for a
moment or two stared thoughtfully out into the garden.
</p>

<p>
"What about the estate?" he asked, turning round
suddenly.  "Who comes into the property?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin shrugged his shoulders.  "There
again I am completely at sea.  I presume that it
passes to the next of kin, but who that fortunate
person may be I haven't the remotest notion."
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't Mr. Carter made a will?"
</p>

<p>
"Not that I'm aware of.  I suggested to him several
times that he ought to take some steps in the matter,
but he always made the excuse that he was too busy
to be bothered about it at the moment.  As so often
happens in these cases, the opportunity has now gone
by for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Then if no one comes forward the money passes
to the Crown?"
</p>

<p>
"That is so; but it's not a situation which is likely
to occur.  In view of the large fortune at stake some
claimant is certain to put in an appearance."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector raised his eyebrows.  "A large fortune,
eh?" he repeated.  "Can you give us any idea of
what it amounts to?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin reflected.  "The Professor has been
saving money for years," he said slowly.  "He drew
a big income from his various patents, and his personal
expenditure was comparatively trifling.  Some of his
experiments were naturally rather costly, but, all the
same, there can be no doubt that he was an extremely
wealthy man.  As a rough estimate I should say that
he was worth at least a couple of hundred thousand
pounds."

<h3>
CHAPTER SIX
</h3>

<p>
"We find that Professor Carter was wilfully
murdered by some person or persons unknown."
</p>

<p>
The foreman of the jury, a stout, pompous little
man who was evidently pleased with his temporary
importance, announced the verdict in a loud and
impressive voice.
</p>

<p>
A moment's silence followed as the Coroner wrote
down the words, and then, amid a general murmur
of voices and shuffling of papers, the crowded court
commenced to break up.
</p>

<p>
Colin, who was sitting on one of the back benches,
remained in his place while the building slowly emptied
itself.  At last, just as it was clearing, the Inspector
and Mr. Medwin appeared together in the gangway,
and, picking up his hat, he stepped out to join them.
</p>

<p>
The solicitor was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
"An unsatisfactory verdict," he observed, "but,
considering the entire lack of any definite evidence, I
suppose it was the only one that could be expected."
</p>

<p>
"I've no complaint to make," remarked Marsden.
"I should say that it summed up the situation
exactly."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're as much concerned with finding out
the truth as either of us," returned the other, "but I
must confess to being a little disappointed that we've
made no further progress.  It seems extraordinary
that a crime like this can be committed, and that there
should be absolutely no clue to the murderer."
</p>

<p>
"It's a remarkable case all round," agreed Marsden.
"One of its most peculiar features is the fact that
no one has yet come forward to claim relationship
with the Professor.  I suppose you've discovered
nothing fresh about his private affairs since our
conversation yesterday?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," was the answer.  "If I had I should
have informed the Coroner.  My own opinion is
that before long we are bound to get on the right
track, and in the meanwhile the only thing to do is
to go on with the business of winding up the estate.
I am working in conjunction with the solicitor for
the Treasury, and he assures me that we shall be
allowed plenty of time to make the most exhaustive
inquiries before the Crown takes any steps to put
forward a claim."  He turned to Colin.  "By the way, I
wanted to have a talk with you, Gray," he added.
"I understand that your arrangement with the Professor
was only a verbal one, but, all the same, I think
you are at least entitled to six months' salary.  I will
discuss the point with the Treasury, and, should they
raise no objection, I will take the responsibility of
forwarding you a cheque."
</p>

<p>
"It's very good of you," said Colin coolly, "but if
you won't think me ungrateful I would much prefer
that you allowed the matter to drop.  I am not in
need of money, and the small amount of work I did
has already been exceedingly well paid for."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medwin smiled benevolently.
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please," he observed.  "It's refreshing
to come across any one who takes such a modest
and unmercenary view of their services."  He paused.
"I have no idea what your plans are," he continued,
"but should you be anxious to obtain some particular
appointment I shall be only too delighted to do
anything I can to assist you.  I know that Mr. Carter
entertained the very highest opinion of your abilities."
</p>

<p>
"I am not looking out for a new job at present,"
replied Colin bluntly.  "I am going to find the man
who murdered the Professor.  There'll be time enough
to think about my own affairs after he's been tried and
hanged."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the court clock chimed the hour, and
with a sudden air of surprise Mr. Medwin pulled out
his watch.
</p>

<p>
"One o'clock," he exclaimed.  "I didn't realize it
was so late.  I have promised to lunch with a client
of mine, so I'm afraid I must hurry off."  He shook
hands with each of them in turn.  "I need hardly say
I wish you both every success in your investigations.
You will no doubt keep me informed of any discoveries
you make, and sooner or later, if we all work together,
I feel convinced that the truth will come out."
</p>

<p>
With a friendly nod he turned toward the door,
and the next moment Colin and the Inspector were left
alone.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why it is," said Colin.  "I've nothing
against that chap, but somehow or other I feel dead
certain that he's a wrong 'un."
</p>

<p>
"We shall be very unpopular if we stop and discuss
the matter here," replied Marsden.  "They've been
waiting to shut the court for the last five minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, suppose we go and have some lunch," suggested
Colin.  "I know quite a decent place round the
corner in the High Street, and there are one or two
things I'd like to have a talk about if you're not in a
great hurry."
</p>

<p>
"I was going to propose it myself," replied Marsden.
"I've got one of our men coming down to take
some photographs at the Red Lodge this afternoon.
He'll be along about a quarter to two, so that will just
spin out the time until he arrives."
</p>

<p>
They left the court, and a few minutes later they
were seated at a table in a discreet little French
restaurant, the stout proprietress of which greeted Colin
with a motherly and familiar smile.
</p>

<p>
"It's curious you should have said that about our
legal friend," began Marsden, as soon as they had
given their order.  "I don't set much store myself on
what people call instincts; I've seen too many of 'em
go wrong.  All the same, from the moment I clapped
my eyes on this fellow Medwin I've had a sort of
feeling that he was keeping something up his sleeve."
</p>

<p>
"Something to do with the murder?" demanded Colin.
</p>

<p>
Marsden broke off a bit of crust and chewed it
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"On the whole I should say not," he replied.
"There's no getting away from the fact that he was
knocked all of a heap when he heard the news.  I'm
more inclined to think that he's up to some hanky-panky
with regard to the old man's money.  He may
have a notion who the rightful heirs are, and, if so,
he's probably lying low with the idea of making a bit
out of it himself."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of a standing has he got in his
profession?" asked Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, good enough as far as it goes," returned the
detective.  "Still, I thought there'd be no harm in
making a few inquiries, so I've asked Ainsworth to
tackle the job himself.  It will have to be done
carefully, of course; if Medwin got wind of the fact he'd
probably kick up the devil of a dust."
</p>

<p>
"Are you any further on at all with regard to the
murder?" asked Colin.
</p>

<p>
Marsden gave a warning glance in the direction
of the returning waiter, and for several minutes the
two of them remained silent, while a deftly moving
Italian attended to their needs.
</p>

<p>
"There's no point in informing the rest of the
world," remarked Marsden, as soon as they were
alone again, "but, to tell you the truth, we seem to
be up against a blank wall.  I didn't say too much
to the Coroner, chiefly on account of the newspapers.
Some of them are always waiting for a chance to dig
out the old stunt about the incompetence of Scotland
Yard, so in a case like this it's just as well to give the
impression that we're keeping something in the
background.  As a matter of cold fact, I only wish we
were."
</p>

<p>
"What about those pet black sheep of yours?"
inquired Colin.  "Haven't you succeeded in rounding
them up yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we've rounded 'em up all right.  We've scraped
through our list of regulars with a fine pocket-comb,
and if any of them had so much as a finger in the job
I'll eat my hat in this restaurant."
</p>

<p>
"Then you've changed your opinion?" said Colin.
"You're beginning to believe&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Marsden shook his head.  "No," he interrupted
doggedly, "I'll stake my reputation that the man who
opened the lock of that safe was a professional
cracksman.  He may have been a foreigner, of course, and
if that's the case it would account for the fact that
none of our people here know anything about him.
However, I've cabled to Paris and New York, and
several other places, to ask them if any of their own
experts are missing, and it's quite possible I may get
an answer from them that will put us on the right
track.  If I do I'll send you along a line."  He
paused to refill his glass.  "By the way," he added,
"where shall I be able to find you?"
</p>

<p>
"I've taken a room at the Kensington Palace Hotel
for a day or two," said Colin.  "I've really made no
plans yet.  As I told Medwin, I mean to see this thing
through before I attempt to settle down to any fresh
work."  He pushed away his plate, the contents of
which he had hardly tasted, and lighted himself a
cigarette.  "How about the Professor's old servant?"
he asked.  "Any news of him yet?"
</p>

<p>
"That's another of our failures," admitted the
detective wryly.  "Ainsworth's men have been ransacking
the country, but so far they seem to have drawn an
absolute blank."  He stopped suddenly, and, putting
his hand in his pocket, produced a rather crumpled
envelope.  "Talking of Ainsworth, I've got something
here for you.  It's the report we promised you the
other day about some party you wanted us to look up.
I'd have posted it on before only you told me that you
weren't in any particular hurry."
</p>

<p>
He passed over the note, and, hastily expressing
his thanks, Colin tore open the flap.  In the rush and
excitement of recent events his interest in Major
Fenton had been temporarily forgotten, but the mere
mention of the subject was quite sufficient to arouse all
his previous curiosity.
</p>

<p>
He extracted the sheet of paper which the envelope
contained, and, unfolding it with eager fingers, spread
it out before him on the table.  It was just a single
page of neat typewriting, without any address or date.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
Major F. is the only son of the late John Mordaunt
F., of Cheltenham, Glos.  He is forty-three
years of age.  He was educated at Cheltenham
College.  Entered the 17th Lancers, but resigned his
commission as a captain on account of financial
difficulties.  Was in India for several years and
also in Canada.  It is believed that he was chiefly
engaged in training and selling polo ponies.
Rejoined the Service during the war and rose to his
present rank.  Since then his only occupation
appears to have been betting at race-meetings.  He
is connected with an undesirable element on the
Turf, and his general reputation is not of the best.
As far as this country is concerned, however, there
is no record of his having been connected with any
criminal proceedings.  He is an amateur yachtsman,
and the registered owner of a small auxiliary
engined boat called <i>The Swallow</i>, which is at
present lying in Hole Haven.
</p>

<p class="quote">
This paper is to be destroyed as soon as its
contents have been noted.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As Colin reached the concluding paragraph the
Inspector rose from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you've got the information you wanted,"
he said.  "I must be off now, or I shall be late for
my appointment.  Are you coming along up to the
house?"
</p>

<p>
Colin thrust away the paper in his inside pocket.
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact," he said, "I'd half promised
to go down to Shadwell.  My pal, the doctor there,
is very keen to know the result of the inquest.  Still,
if there's any way in which I can be of help&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Marsden beckoned to the waiter.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he interrupted.  "You stick to your
arrangement.  We're only going to take a few photographs
of the study, just to show the exact position in
which the body was lying.  They may come in useful
later on."
</p>

<p>
He asked for the bill, which, in spite of Colin's
protest, he insisted upon paying, and, leaving the
restaurant, they stepped out on to the crowded
pavement.
</p>

<p>
"I'm making for the station," explained Colin.
"My car's having some new valves fitted, so I shall go
down by train."
</p>

<p>
"Well, so long for the present," was the Inspector's
reply.  "I'll let you know at the hotel directly there's
any news, and if you should want to get in touch with
me yourself you've only got to ring up the Yard.
Even if I'm not there they can always send me a message."
</p>

<p>
With a parting handshake he disappeared among
the traffic, and a few minutes later, having purchased
a ticket for Shadwell, Colin was descending the steps
which led down to the underground railway.
</p>

<p>
As the train rumbled eastward he again pulled out
the paper which Marsden had handed him, and read it
through carefully a second time.  Brief though it was,
it certainly presented Major Fenton in a far from
flattering light.  Apart from its own uncomplimentary
phrases, it suggested that the account of himself which
he had given to Nancy was probably quite untrue.
Whatever his exact reasons for going abroad might
have been, it was clear that they had nothing to do
with the demands of military service.  That he had
only returned to England in the spring was also
apparently a piece of deliberate fiction.  Unless the
police were wrong, he had been a conspicuous figure at
race meetings ever since the conclusion of the war;
conspicuous, too, in a fashion which seemed to clash
rather badly with the chivalrous role he had adopted in
his relations toward Nancy.
</p>

<p>
Had he really been acquainted with her father at
all?  It was a question which Colin had already asked
himself on several occasions, and in view of what he
had just read his doubts on the subject became more
pronounced than ever.  The details of the story were
so improbable, and the professed motive so extremely
unlikely, that in the absence of any other evidence
except the Major's own statement all his beliefs
inclined in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that Nancy ought certainly to be
enlightened concerning the somewhat unreliable nature
of her "guardian's" claims.  The job was not a
particularly attractive one, for she had given him no
authority to make inquiries, and the character of an
unauthorized Paul Pry is about the last that any one
would wish to assume.  Besides, there was the awkward
fact that Fenton had already cautioned Nancy
against him, and it might well appear to a third person
that in bringing this counter-charge he was merely
gratifying his own private resentment.
</p>

<p>
Still, even at the risk of being misunderstood it was
clearly his duty to put her on her guard.  He would
show her the report, and tell her frankly how it had
come into his possession, and if the consequences
proved to be unfortunate he must put up with them as
best he could.
</p>

<p>
It was at the precise moment when he had arrived
at this decision that the train ran into Whitechapel
station.  He got out in company with a number of
other passengers bound for the less fashionable
quarters of East End London, and, crossing the line by a
covered bridge, descended into the narrow and dimly lit
vault where passengers to Shadwell await their destiny.
</p>

<p>
As he reached the platform the figure of a man
sitting by himself on a solitary bench suddenly
attracted his attention, and, stepping promptly forward
to the seat, he gave its occupant a sounding slap on the
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Cheer up, Joe," he said.  "There's sure to be a
train some time to-day."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Joseph Bates&mdash;for it was none other than
the ex-pugilist&mdash;jumped to his feet with a grin of
welcome.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm blarsted," he exclaimed.  "Caught me
proper, that you did, sir.  Who'd ever have thought
o' meeting you 'ere?"
</p>

<p>
He held out a large and not over-clean hand, which
Colin shook heartily.
</p>

<p>
"I was just saying to meself only yesterday,"
continued Joe, "some time when I get a free mornin' I
must do a trip up to the 'orspital an' tell the doctor
abaht my bit o' good luck."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" demanded Colin, taking a seat beside
him on the bench.  "Have you fallen in love, or
is somebody offering you a job at a brewery?"
</p>

<p>
"You'd never guess," returned Joe with a chuckle,
"not if you was to try for a month o' Sundays."  He
removed a short clay pipe from the corner of his
mouth and spat contentedly on to the platform.  "I
gorn back into the perfession, guv'nor, that's wot I
done."
</p>

<p>
Colin eyed him incredulously.  "That's a good one,
Joe," he observed.  "Who are you going to fight&mdash;Jack
Dempsey?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tain't a joke, guv'nor.  I'm back in the old business
again, gospel truth I am, but not as wot you might
call a principal."  He paused, as though to give full
weight to his coming disclosure.  "You've 'eard tell
o' Solly Moss and the Palace o' Sport?"
</p>

<p>
"What, the new boxing ring in Whitechapel?"
</p>

<p>
"That's it&mdash;that's the place I'm gettin' at.  Well,
the very day after I see'd you and the young lady
ahtside the club, who should I run across in the street
but old Solly Moss 'isself.  'Im an' me was pals once,
before 'e come up in the world, an' 'e's got a good
'eart, Solly 'as&mdash;especially for a Sheeny.  We 'as a bit
of a talk like, an' a couple o' drinks, an' he says to
me, 'Joe,' 'e says, 'you come along dahn to my 'all, an'
damn me if I don't find you a job.'  An' wot's more,
'e's done it, guv'nor.  I'm caretaker, chucker-aht, and
one o' the two official seconds, with thirty bob a week
an' me name on the bleedin' programme."
</p>

<p>
"I congratulate you," said Colin.  "It must be an
interesting job, but it sounds to me as if it was a bit
underpaid."
</p>

<p>
"There're pickin's," returned Joe, with a wink.  "A
good second can do a lot toward pullin' orf a fight, an'
it gen'rally means arf a crown when you 'appen to be
in the winnin' corner.  Besides"&mdash;he licked his lips&mdash;"me
bein' in wot you might call an official position,
folks as is interested in the game likes to make
'emselves civil.  Why, this 'ere job will be worth quarts
an' quarts o' beer to me every week."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the train steamed into the station, and
with a simultaneous movement both of them rose to
their feet.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you off to?" asked Colin.  "I get out
at Shadwell."
</p>

<p>
"That's my mark, too," replied Joe.  "I gotter
go an' see the bloke wot supplies us with our jellied
eels.  They ain't bin up to standard lately, an' old
Solly, 'e's arsked me to call rahnd and tell 'em wot
'e can do with 'em."
</p>

<p>
They took their seats along with the rest of the
passengers, and a few minutes more brought them to
the equally grimy platform which serves to connect
Shadwell with the outside world.
</p>

<p>
As they mounted the long flight of steps up to the
street Colin again addressed his companion.
</p>

<p>
"It's no use your coming to the hospital now, Joe,"
he said.  "I've left there for good."
</p>

<p>
"Started one of your own, sir?" inquired Joe innocently.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," replied Colin.  "I am what you might
call marking time at the moment, but I expect I shall
be settling down again soon, and when I do I'll let
you know my address.  However, I shall probably
see you again before then.  I am sure to be down here
a good deal with my friend Doctor Ashton, and one
afternoon I'll walk over to your place and see if there's
anything doing.  I'd like to have the gloves on again,
just for a bit of practice."
</p>

<p>
"You come along, guv'nor," returned Joe with
enthusiasm.  "There's gen'rally one or two useful
lads messin' arahnd, and we'll fix you up with some
bloke who can take a decent punch."
</p>

<p>
They surrendered their tickets to the porter on duty,
and, having passed through the doorway, Colin
stopped for a moment on the pavement outside to light
himself a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
He was in the act of throwing away the match
when he happened to glance across the street.  As
he did so he caught sight of two men who were standing
in the doorway of a small public house opposite.
To an ordinary observer there was nothing particularly
striking about their appearance, except for the
fact that one of them was unusually well dressed.  If
they had been Indians in full war-paint, however, the
effect upon Colin could hardly have been more remarkable.
He remained stock still, his eyes riveted upon
the taller of the pair.  Although the latter's face was
half turned away, there could be no possible mistake.
It was Fenton himself, the very man of all others who
chiefly occupied his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Anything wrong, guv'nor?" inquired Joe curiously.
</p>

<p>
The sound of his companion's voice restored Colin's
faculties at once.  With a quick movement he caught
hold of the other's arm, and, drawing him along the
pavement for a few paces, pulled up behind the
shelter of a deserted cart.
</p>

<p>
"Joe," he said, "you see those two fellows over
there in the door of the pub?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Moss's lieutenant squinted furtively round the
backboard.
</p>

<p>
"Wot abaht 'em?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any idea who either of them is?"
</p>

<p>
"Dunno the torf," was the answer.  "T'other one's
a bloke they call 'Spike' Cooper."
</p>

<p>
"Is he a friend of yours?"
</p>

<p>
Joe laughed derisively.  "Not much.  I ain't
pertic'ler, but I likes to draw the line somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's a bad lot, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"That's as it may be," replied Joe cautiously.  "I
ain't sayin' nothing, not one way nor the other, but
any'ow, I don't fancy 'is comp'ny."
</p>

<p>
From the security of his retreat Colin subjected
"Spike" Cooper to a critical examination.  He was a
tough-looking customer with broad, powerful shoulders
and a lean, mahogany-coloured face.  In spite of
his somewhat shabby clothes he was evidently on
familiar terms with Fenton, for he lounged back against
the wall with his hands in his pockets and a half-smoked
cigarette hanging from the corner of his lips.
</p>

<p>
Colin turned to Joe.  "Where did you come across
him?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The ex-pugilist wrinkled his forehead.  "Well, I
can't say to rights.  I think it was the Blue Boar at
Shoreditch.  'E's bin 'anging arahnd these pubs for
the last two months, though where 'e come from afore
that Gawd knows.  Some kind of a Yank, I reckon,
judgin' by 'is talk."
</p>

<p>
Colin took another long and deliberate stare at the
oddly assorted couple.
</p>

<p>
"Joe," he said, "will you do something for me?"
</p>

<p>
"You ain't no call to ask that," returned Joe a little
reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"I want to know all I can about that chap.  I want
you to follow him round and find out who his pals are
and where he's living.  Do you think you could
manage it without giving away the show?"
</p>

<p>
Joe's eyes brightened.  "That's orl right, guv'nor,"
he replied encouragingly.  "Jes' you push orf an' leave
the job to me.  I'll pick up 'is tracks now, after this
'ere cabinet council's over.  There ain't no 'urry abaht
them there jellied eels."
</p>

<p>
"You're a brick, Joe," said Colin gratefully.  "If
you do happen to find out anything you might call
round at Doctor Ashton's.  You know his house in the
High Street?"
</p>

<p>
Joe nodded.
</p>

<p>
"If I'm not there you've only got to leave a message
that you want to see me and I'll be over at the Palace
as soon as I get it."  He put his hand in his pocket
and pulled out a couple of one pound notes.  "Better
take these," he added.  "You might want to do a little
bribery and corruption."
</p>

<p>
Joe accepted the money and slipped it inside his belt.
</p>

<p>
"You leave it to me, guv'nor," he whispered, "and
don't you start worryin' if you don't 'ear nothin' fur a
day or two.  'E's the sorter cove that's got to be
'andled cunnin', but I'll run 'im dahn right enough
afore I done with 'im.  I'll stick to 'im like 'is bleedin'
shadder."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the two men opposite moved forward
out of the shelter of the door.  They stood for a
moment on the edge of the pavement, exchanging a few
final remarks, and then, with a curt nod to his
companion, Fenton stepped into the roadway, and began
to cross the street in the direction of the station.
</p>

<p>
Keeping well behind the cart, Colin waited until he
was safely in the booking-office.
</p>

<p>
"We seem to be in luck, Joe," he observed cheerfully.
"The pubs are shut, so if our pal's got a home
he's probably on his way there now."
</p>

<p>
He nodded toward the retreating figure of Mr. "Spike"
Cooper, who with his hands still in his pockets
was sauntering away casually up the street.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't unlikely," returned Joe, with an appreciative
grin.  "Any'ow, we'll 'ave a nice little walk
rahnd the 'ouses, an' if we don't do nothing else, we'll
get 'old of a decent thirst."
</p>

<p>
He knocked out his pipe, and, thrusting it into his
pocket, drifted off inconspicuously amongst the stream
of passers-by.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing had happened so quickly that up
till then Colin's chief feeling had been one of complete
surprise.  Left to himself, however, the real significance
of Fenton's appearance in this out-of-the-way
neighbourhood suddenly came home to him with
convincing force.  Shadwell was about the last part of
London that such a man would be likely to patronize
unless he had some extremely definite reason for
undertaking the journey.  Only one reason suggested
itself to Colin, namely, the presence of Nancy at Mark's
house.  That was certainly sufficient to account for
the Major's visit, though why he should be standing
in the door of an adjacent pub, talking to an obvious
ruffian like Mr. "Spike" Cooper, was another problem
to which no immediate answer seemed to be forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
Pondering over this point as he walked toward
the surgery, Colin felt exceedingly thankful that he
had had the happy inspiration to despatch Joe in
pursuit of the stranger.  If some underhand business
were going on in connection with Nancy, it would
be just as well to make certain whether this
sinister-looking individual had anything to do with the
proceedings.  Of course, it was quite possible that
the two men had met merely by chance.  Being mixed
up with the Turf, Fenton no doubt possessed a number
of undesirable acquaintances, and he might have
stumbled across one of them accidentally just as he was
about to enter the station.  That, indeed, seemed to
be the most likely explanation, but, even so, any
information that Joe could pick up would certainly not
be wasted.  If it served no other purpose, it would
probably assist in opening Nancy's eyes to Fenton's
true character, and for the moment, at all events,
that was the principal object which Colin had in his
mind.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the front gate of the surgery he found
its owner standing on the doorstep, in the act of
bidding good-bye to a patient.  Almost simultaneously
the latter took his departure, and with a hail of
welcome Mark stepped forward to greet him.
</p>

<p>
"The very lad I wanted," was his opening remark.
"In fact, I was just going to ring up the hotel and see
if I could get hold of you."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you were keen to hear about the inquest,"
replied Colin, "and, being a gentleman of leisure, I
thought I might as well oblige you."
</p>

<p>
Mark drew him into the house, and relieved him of
his hat and stick.
</p>

<p>
"Come along upstairs," he whispered.  "Nancy's
doing the books, and there are half-a-dozen blighters
in the waiting room, but I must hear what's happened,
even if it ruins the business."
</p>

<p>
He led the way to the study, where they found
Nancy seated at a roll-top desk, with a couple of
formidable ledgers spread open in front of her.  She
glanced up at their entrance, and then, laying down her
pen, swung round smilingly in her chair.
</p>

<p>
"You must tear yourself away from work for a
minute or two," said Mark.  "Colin has come to
report progress."
</p>

<p>
He dropped down on the sofa, and, pulling out his
pipe, began hastily stuffing it with tobacco.
</p>

<p>
"Fire ahead," he continued.  "Let's have the whole
story.  I'm dying to hear what's happened, and it will
just give me time for a comfortable smoke."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to shake hands with Nancy first," said
Colin.
</p>

<p>
He crossed the room, and, having performed the
operation, very deliberately seated himself beside her
on top of the padded brass fire-guard.
</p>

<p>
From this position he proceeded to give them a
brief but lucid sketch of what had taken place at the
inquest.  He described the evidence of the various
witnesses, the summing-up of the Coroner, and the
final and unsatisfying verdict of the jury, concluding
with a short account of how he had met Mr. Medwin
and the Inspector after it was over and the views
which they had expressed with regard to the situation.
</p>

<p>
"So, you see, we are more or less at a stop for the
moment," he finished.  "The police aren't likely to do
much until they find the Professor's old servant or get
an answer to their cable, and as for Medwin&mdash;well, I
don't believe he cares the least whether the murderer's
discovered or not.  The money is what he's interested
in, and both Marsden and I have got a notion
that he's playing some low-down game of his own."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of game?" inquired Nancy, who had
been listening to the whole narrative with absorbed interest.
</p>

<p>
"We don't know, but Marsden thinks he may have
some idea who the rightful heir is, and that he's lying
low until he sees the chance of pulling off a fat
commission."
</p>

<p>
Nancy opened her eyes in astonishment.  "Surely
he wouldn't be so dishonest!" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"I hope not," replied Colin; "but, after all, he's a
lawyer."
</p>

<p>
Mark hoisted himself up in his chair.  "I protest,"
he said.  "I am not going to have Nancy's ingenuous
mind corrupted by any beastly cynicism."  He turned
to Colin.  "And how about you?" he added more
seriously.  "This infernal business must have played the
mischief with all your plans."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm just marking time," said Colin.  "I mean
to see this thing through before I attempt to do
anything else."
</p>

<p>
Mark nodded approvingly.  "That's right," he
remarked.  "That's your job, plain enough."  He
glanced at Nancy.  "I'm afraid our idea won't work,"
he added.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a secret?" demanded Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as a matter of fact I was going to ask you
whether you could do us a good turn.  If you're busy,
however&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I should have to be devilish busy to let you down,"
said Colin.  "What's the trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Mary's mother," was the answer.  "There's
been some unexpected development in the case, and
they have got to operate the day after to-morrow.
Mary is desperately anxious for me to go up, and I
can't possibly get away unless I can find someone to
look after the practice.  I thought that you might be
able to manage it, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"'But' be blowed," interrupted Colin.  "I only
want to be around in case Marsden needs me, and I
shall be quite as handy here as at the Palace Hotel.
How long do you expect to be away?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose I shall be more than a couple of
days.  It just depends whether the operation is a success."
</p>

<p>
"Well, consider that settled," said Colin.  "It won't
interfere with my plans in the least; in fact, I shall be
only too glad to have something else to think about."
</p>

<p>
Mark got up from the sofa, and, crossing the rug,
held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Put it there, my son," he said gratefully.  "You're
a good pal, and the family thanks you."
</p>

<p>
Colin laughed.  "You'd better wait till you come
back," he replied.  "You'll probably find that I've
cured half your patients."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care a hang about what you do with them,"
said Mark callously.  He turned toward Nancy.  "I
shall leave you in charge of each other," he added.
"You must keep Colin posted in his job, and he must
look after you and try to make himself agreeable."  He
paused, and added chaffingly, "I don't know
whether Major Fenton will approve of the arrangement,
but I'm afraid we've hardly time to consult him."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief but pregnant silence.
</p>

<p>
"Major Fenton?" repeated Colin blankly.
</p>

<p>
Mark chuckled.  "You've met him, haven't you?
A kind of adopted uncle of Nancy's.  He rolled up
here quite unexpectedly about half-past twelve this
morning.  I suppose he really came to see whether
the place was respectable or not, and on the whole
I think we managed to set his mind at rest.  Anyhow,
he made himself extremely pleasant, so of course I
asked him to stop to lunch."
</p>

<p>
Colin flashed a quick glance at Nancy, who was
looking distinctly uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he said, "that explains things.  I thought I
caught sight of him in the street just as I was leaving
the station."
</p>

<p>
"He appears to take a great interest in Nancy,"
pursued Mark, with a mischievous smile, "but somehow
or other she doesn't exactly seem to appreciate it."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't invite him here," protested Nancy, "and
I don't think he had any right to come."
</p>

<p>
Before Mark could reply there was a tap outside,
and the harassed features of Martha Jane intruded
themselves round the door.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, doctor," she said, "there's another
four patients in the waiting room.  That makes nine
altogether."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, damn!" said Mark.  "I suppose I must go
down and see them.  You'll stay to tea, Colin, of
course?"
</p>

<p>
"If I'm not in the way," was the answer.  "Perhaps
I'd better go out for a stroll and come back."
</p>

<p>
"You stop here and talk to Nancy," replied Mark.
"There's no hurry about the books, and she can save
me a lot of trouble by explaining how we run the
practice.  She really knows rather more about it than I
do."
</p>

<p>
He knocked out his pipe, and, thrusting it into his
pocket, hurried off downstairs on the heels of Martha
Jane.
</p>

<p>
Colin closed the door and came back to where
Nancy was sitting.
</p>

<p>
"So Fenton's sense of duty is still in good working
order," he observed.
</p>

<p>
With a little impatient gesture Nancy brushed aside
a stray curl.
</p>

<p>
"I was very annoyed at his coming down here," she
said.  "If I'd thought for a moment that he was going
to do a thing like that I shouldn't have given him my
address."
</p>

<p>
Colin took up his old position on the fire-guard
and looked thoughtfully into her indignant blue
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What did he want, Nancy?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was only to invite me to dine and go to a
theatre with him on Wednesday.  Of course, he could
just as well have written to me or rung me up on the
telephone."
</p>

<p>
"And did you accept?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy shrugged her shoulders.  "I couldn't very
well help it.  He asked me while we were at lunch,
and I didn't like to say I was engaged, because Doctor
Ashton would have known it was untrue."
</p>

<p>
"Otherwise you would have refused him?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy nodded.  "It may seem ungrateful, but as a
matter of fact I don't want to see Major Fenton again.
I never liked him very much, and the last time I was
with him he&mdash;&mdash;"  She hesitated.  "Oh, well, he was
different in a way, and, to put it quite plainly, I liked
him even less.  Besides, I haven't forgotten the horrid
things he said about you."
</p>

<p>
Colin searched in his pocket and pulled out the
report which Marsden had given him.
</p>

<p>
"That makes my job a bit easier," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
She gazed curiously at the slip of paper.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
Colin sat back, still holding it in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I've been doing a quite unpardonable sort of thing,
Nancy," he said.  "Before I tell you, will you promise
to forgive me?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," she said, smiling.  "I can always forgive
anything that's really unpardonable.  It makes
one feel so nice and generous."
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for further encouragement Colin
plunged at once into a full description of how he had
taken advantage of the Inspector's half-joking offer
to make some inquiries with regard to Fenton's
character and reputation.  He told the whole story quite
simply, allowing his own motives in the matter to be
taken for granted, and ended by reading her the report.
</p>

<p>
Nancy, who had listened to him gravely, made no
comment until he had finished.
</p>

<p>
Then with a quaint and rather rueful little laugh
she looked up into his face.
</p>

<p>
"It's a disappointing world, isn't it?" she said.  "I
did honestly believe that there was something kind and
unselfish about his original intentions."  She paused.
"And you say you saw him in the street?  Why, he
must have left here over an hour ago."
</p>

<p>
"I saw him all right," repeated Colin.
</p>

<p>
He went on to describe his meeting with Joe and
the interesting events which had ensued on their
arrival at Shadwell station.
</p>

<p>
"I may be prejudiced," he concluded, "but I'm
beginning to think that he's an even bigger scoundrel
than the police give him credit for.  Anyhow, it's
perfectly plain that he's been lying to you from start to
finish."
</p>

<p>
"But why should he?" objected Nancy.
</p>

<p>
It was Colin's turn to hesitate.  "Well, after all,
you're rather pretty, you know," he said lamely.
</p>

<p>
Nancy laughed again.  "I've no doubt you're right,"
she said, "but I don't see that it solves the difficulty.
He couldn't have known what I was like when he came
and hunted me out."
</p>

<p>
"No, that's true," admitted Colin.  He got off his
seat and paced slowly up and down the room.  "There's
something behind all this, Nancy," he added; "some
infernal mystery that we don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"There is," agreed Nancy; "but I mean to understand
it, and very soon, too."
</p>

<p>
Colin stopped.  "You're not thinking of keeping
that appointment?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "Of course I'm going to keep it.
If I don't, how can I find out what he wants?"  She
rose from her chair and came forward to where Colin
was standing.  "I&mdash;I'm awfully grateful for what
you've done," she said shyly, "and I can't tell you what
a comfort it is to know that I've got someone who's
ready to help me."  She paused.  "All the same,"
she added, "I'm not in the least frightened of Major
Fenton.  I've had a lot of practice in looking after
myself."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER SEVEN
</h3>

<p>
With an inward sigh of relief Colin opened the door
of the surgery, and beckoned to the solitary old
woman who was still sitting grimly in the corner of
the waiting room.  She was the thirty-fourth patient
he had interviewed that morning, and the prospect
of a well-earned lunch with Nancy was beginning to
dangle pleasantly in front of his exhausted spirits.
</p>

<p>
The old woman entered the surgery, and, after
placing a bulky string bag upon his consulting table,
deposited herself in an armchair alongside.
</p>

<p>
Colin took his own seat and smiled at her encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, mother," he said, "what's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
The patient folded her hands.  "I've bin pizened,"
she said.  "That's wot's the matter with me, young
man.  I've bin pizened."
</p>

<p>
Colin sat back and nodded gravely.  "When did
this happen?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" said the lady, rather bitterly.  "That's the
very pint I'm comin' to.  Are you a pertickler friend
o' Doctor Hashton's?"
</p>

<p>
"I am," said Colin.  "That's why I'm taking his
practice."
</p>

<p>
"In that case," continued the visitor, "I don't mind
telling you, young man, that it was 'im as done it."
</p>

<p>
"What, poisoned you?" exclaimed Colin.  "Surely not."
</p>

<p>
The lady reached for her bag, and, after fumbling
among its contents, produced a half empty bottle of
medicine.  She handed this to Colin, who examined
the label.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Mrs. Jones?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, young man," was the answer.  "Mrs. Jones
o' Baxter's Rents, and there ain't no one in
Shadwell wot can say to the contrary."
</p>

<p>
"And why do you think that Doctor Ashton has
poisoned you?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jones leaned forward mysteriously and tapped
the bottle.
</p>

<p>
"You can see for yourself, young man.  'E's given
me the wrong medicine.  Mind you, I don't say that
'e done it a purpose.  I expect 'e was a bit 'urried and
made a mistake.  All the same, there ain't no gettin'
away from it.  'E's given me the wrong medicine, an'
I'm pizened."
</p>

<p>
Colin extracted the cork and took a sniff at the contents.
</p>

<p>
"It seems all right to me," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing wrong with the smell," admitted
Mrs. Jones.  "It's the colour wot I'm speakin' about."
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with the colour?" demanded
Colin.  "Some of the best medicines are red."
</p>

<p>
"Not mine," returned Mrs. Jones doggedly.  "My
medicine's yeller, always 'as bin.  The moment I set
me eyes on that bottle I says to meself, ''E's made a
mistake.'"
</p>

<p>
"Then why on earth did you take it?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jones looked a trifle surprised.  "Well, young
man, I'd paid ninepence for it, an', not knowin' then
as it was pizen, I didn't see no reason for wastin' the
money."
</p>

<p>
"And you say it made you ill?"
</p>

<p>
"It's only through the mercy o' Gawd that I'm
sittin' 'ere now," said Mrs. Jones impressively.
"D'rec'ly the third dose passed me lips I come over
queer."
</p>

<p>
Colin poured out a little of the medicine into a glass
and tasted it judiciously.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you've any reason to be anxious,
Mrs. Jones," he said.  "Doctor Ashton was only trying you
with a new prescription.  It's a very good one indeed,
but I suppose it doesn't quite suit your constitution."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jones looked round and lowered her voice.
"If that's the case," she demanded, "why 'as 'e run away?"
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't run away," said Colin.  "He's coming
back to-morrow or the next day.  He's only gone up
north to look after his wife's mother."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Mrs. Jones doubtfully, "I 'as my own
opinions on that point, but seein' as 'ow you're a friend
of 'is I don't blame you for standin' up for 'im.
Besides, between you an' me, young man, I wouldn't get
Doctor Hashton into trouble, not on no account.  We
all make mistakes at times, even the best of us.  You
give me a bottle o' the yeller medicine, the same as I
always 'as, an' I sha'n't say no more about it."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," said Colin.  He rose from his
chair, and, crossing to the cupboard where Mark kept
two or three innocuous and highly coloured mixtures
ready made up, filled a bottle with the desired specific.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jones inspected it with approval.
</p>

<p>
"I'm much obliged to you, young man," she observed.
"Hall's well that hends well, as the sayin' is.
You can tell the doctor from me that 'e won't 'ear no
more o' this, so 'e can come back 'ome just as soon as
ever 'e likes."
</p>

<p>
She tucked away the bottle in her bag and made
her exit through the side door, which Colin had
stepped forward to open for her.  As she passed out
Martha Jane appeared in the passage.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ready for lunch, sir?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I'm more than ready," said Colin.  "I'm positively
aching for it."
</p>

<p>
Martha Jane nodded sympathetically.  "It must
be 'ard work for a young gentleman like you, sir, 'avin'
to sit there and listen to all them diseases.  You go
along into the dinin' room and I'll run up and tell Miss
Nancy.  I sha'n't keep you waitin' more than a couple
o' minutes."
</p>

<p>
Colin returned to his desk, and, having completed
his report, with a brief entry on the subject of
Mrs. Jones, made his way out into the hall, where he
encountered Nancy in the act of descending the staircase.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be with you in a second," he said.  "I'm just
going to remove the germs."
</p>

<p>
He hurried across to the cloak room, and, after
changing his coat and indulging in a welcome bout with
a basin of hot water, emerged again in a hungry but
contented humour.
</p>

<p>
Nancy was already seated at the table, looking
disturbingly pretty in her severe and businesslike
costume.  Although, on his arrival at the surgery, they
had spent a crowded quarter of an hour together,
opening the post and discussing the day's work, this
was the first opportunity they had had for anything
like a private conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she inquired cheerfully, "how have you
been getting on this morning?"
</p>

<p>
Colin sank into the vacant chair and stretched out
his hand toward the whisky.
</p>

<p>
"I'm still alive," he said, "but that's about all.
Every day, in every respect, my admiration for Mark
grows deeper and deeper."
</p>

<p>
Nancy pushed across the soda.  "I often wonder
he hasn't broken down," she said.  "It's only sheer
good nature and kindness that keep him going.  He
comes in to lunch every day and says the most blood-curdling
things about the patients, but in his heart he
just loves them all."
</p>

<p>
"I know he does," returned Colin, "and I've been
trying to copy his example.  It's thirsty work, though,
when you come to people like Mrs. Jones."  He took
a long drink and set down the tumbler.  "By the way,
is there any news from him?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Nancy.  "The operation was to
be at ten o'clock, and he promised to wire directly he
knew the result.  We shall probably get a telegram
this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Colin attacked the roast chicken, which Martha
Jane had cooked to perfection, and passed over a
generous helping.
</p>

<p>
"And what about last night?" he inquired.  "I
had no time to ask you anything this morning, but I'm
longing to hear how Fenton behaved himself."
</p>

<p>
"Well, to begin with," said Nancy, "he asked me
to marry him."
</p>

<p>
Colin paused in the act of dissecting a wing.
</p>

<p>
"Did he, by Jove!  I hope you told him to go to
blazes?"
</p>

<p>
"Something rather similar," said Nancy, "only I
tried to put it as nicely as possible."
</p>

<p>
"And how did he take it?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy paused.  "It may sound conceited," she
replied, "but I should say he was more angry and
disappointed than any one I ever saw in my life."
</p>

<p>
"I can quite believe it," said Colin.  "You're just
the sort of girl who'd make a man feel like that."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "I'm not trying to be modest,
Colin.  I know I'm pretty&mdash;even other women have
told me so&mdash;but I assure you my looks have got
nothing to do with the matter.  Do you suppose that a
girl doesn't know when a man is really in love with
her?  Major Fenton doesn't care that for me."  She
snapped her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't wonder if you're right," agreed Colin.
"A chap with a face like that could hardly have much
capacity for romance.  I should say that champagne
was more in his line."
</p>

<p>
"All the same," said Nancy, "he's quite serious
about wanting to marry me, and, what's more, he's
made up his mind that he's going to do it."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" inquired Colin.  "Did he
turn nasty when you told him it was a wash-out?"
</p>

<p>
"Very nasty," said Nancy calmly.  "He accused me
of all sorts of things, my chief crime being that I've
allowed myself to be influenced by you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't want to brag," admitted Colin modestly,
"but I've certainly done my best.  Does he know
that I'm taking Mark's practice?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "Yes, I'd told him at the beginning
of dinner.  I suppose that was what put the idea into
his head."  She stopped.  "Colin," she said, "don't
think me stupid and melodramatic, but do you know,
I am really rather frightened.  There was something
in the way he spoke about you, something that made
me feel as if&mdash;oh, I know it sounds ridiculous&mdash;but as
if you were in actual danger."
</p>

<p>
Colin sat back and smiled contentedly.  "This is
too good to be true," he observed.  "I've been longing
to punch his head ever since he told you that lie about
my leaving the hospital."
</p>

<p>
"But you don't understand," persisted Nancy.  "He
wouldn't try anything himself, of course; he's much
more likely to pay someone else to do it.  You go
about alone all over the place, and in a rough
neighbourhood like Shadwell&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be anxious," interrupted Colin.  "I
shall keep my eyes open, I promise you.  If Fenton's
got hold of the idea that I'm in his way, I can quite
believe he'll stick at nothing."  He paused.  "What
beats me altogether," he added, "is why he wants to
make you his wife.  You haven't the least doubt that
he's really in earnest?"
</p>

<p>
"Not the least.  He even went so far as talking
about a special license, and suggesting that we should
be married this week."
</p>

<p>
"That makes it fishier still," said Colin, frowning.
He stared thoughtfully at his plate for a moment or
two, and then suddenly pushed back his chair.  "I
know what I shall do," he continued.  "I shall tell
Marsden the whole story and ask him for his advice.
I'm perfectly certain there's some damned crooked
business at the back of it."
</p>

<p>
"But you can't possibly bother the police," objected
Nancy.  "After all, Major Fenton has only asked me to
marry him, and there's nothing very criminal in that."
</p>

<p>
"Depends on what you call criminal," said Colin.
"I should say he deserved ten years for his confounded
cheek."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the door opened and Martha Jane
inserted her head.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like any sweet?" she inquired.
"There's a nice plum tart in the kitchen if either of
you fancy a bit."
</p>

<p>
Colin glanced at his watch.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds alluring," he said, "but I don't think I
can spare the time.  I must start out on my round at
half-past, and I shall have to run through the cases
first and see what I've got to take with me."
</p>

<p>
He rose from his chair, Nancy following his example.
</p>

<p>
Martha Jane looked at them both with disapproval.
</p>

<p>
"You're as bad as the doctor, every bit," she
observed.  'Ow do you expect to keep well if you don't
feed proper?  What with this here snatching and
picking it's a wonder to me that you ain't all in your
graves."
</p>

<p>
"You might give us an extra good tea to make up
for it," suggested Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I forgot to tell you," said Nancy.  "I'm
afraid I shall be out when you get back.  I've
promised to go round and see old Mrs. Merivale, one of
Mark's patients."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
Colin's face fell.  "That's a blow," he said sadly.
"I can never enjoy my tea properly unless someone
pours it out for me."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay Martha Jane will do it if you ask her
nicely," said Nancy.  "In any case, I'll try and get
back in time for the second cup."
</p>

<p>
With an encouraging smile she passed out into the
hall, and, having paused to light himself a cigarette,
Colin returned to the surgery.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, with Mark's black bag in one
hand and a stout stick in the other, he set forth into
the chill and uninviting atmosphere of the December
afternoon.  He was not disturbed by Nancy's vague
alarm with regard to his personal safety, but his
practice took him into a pretty rough neighbourhood, and
a good tough ash seemed to him a distinctly suitable
companion.
</p>

<p>
As it turned out, however, the precaution was an
unnecessary one.  During his long ramble through the
lowest parts of Shadwell he met with nothing but
good-natured civility.  Wherever he went, down sordid
alleys and up rickety staircases, a friendly welcome
invariably awaited him.  His experience at the
hospital had given him the knack of getting on readily
with poor people, and, since he had done the same
round on the previous day, he was already on familiar
terms with most of his patients.
</p>

<p>
By the time he returned to the surgery it was close
on five o'clock.  Darkness was rapidly setting in, and
the feeling that his out-of-door duty was over for the
day seemed to lend an additional attraction to the
warmth and comfort of the brightly lit hall.
</p>

<p>
As he closed the front door Martha Jane emerged
from the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
"A man came to see you just after you'd gone out,
sir," she informed him.  "Party of the name of Bates.
Said he'd call again."
</p>

<p>
Colin, who had heard nothing of Joe since they had
parted outside the station, received the news with no
little interest.
</p>

<p>
"Did he mention any particular time?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  'E just said 'e'd look round again later."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let me know at once if he does," he replied.
"I'll see him immediately, no matter how many people
are waiting."
</p>

<p>
Martha Jane nodded.  "There's a letter and a
telegram come for you too, sir.  They're over there on
the hall table."  She paused.  "Per'aps as Miss
Nancy's out you'd like your tea in the surgery?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that will be best," said Colin.  "You can
bring it along in as soon as it's ready."
</p>

<p>
He divested himself of his coat, and, crossing to the
table, picked up the telegram.  As he expected, it
bore the Lincoln postmark, and with eager fingers he
slit open the flap and pulled out the contents.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Operation a complete success.  Shall be home
to-morrow about one.&mdash;MARK."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He turned to Martha Jane.
</p>

<p>
"This is from Doctor Ashton," he said.  "Everything
has gone off splendidly, and he hopes to be back
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"'E would," was the answer.  "Wild 'orses
wouldn't keep 'im from work, not so long as 'e's got
a breath in his body."
</p>

<p>
Colin laughed, and, taking up the letter, walked
forward into the surgery.  A bright fire was burning
away cheerfully in the grate, and, having flicked on the
electric light, he seated himself at his desk and
proceeded to open the envelope.
</p>

<p>
A single glance at the letter inside showed him that
it was from Inspector Marsden.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"SCOTLAND YARD,<br />
  "Thursday, December 12th.<br />
</p>

<p class="quote">
"DEAR DOCTOR GRAY,&mdash;You will be interested
to hear that we have at last managed to pick up
the tracks of William Kennedy, Professor Carter's
servant.  It seems that he has been very ill, and for
the last two months has been living in an out-of-the-way
village in Hertfordshire under the care of
an old female cousin.  The latter, who is apparently
unable to read, had heard nothing about the murder,
and it was only last night that Kennedy was
informed of the facts.  I am making arrangements
to motor down and interview him to-morrow,
don't suppose I shall be back at the Yard until the
evening, but if you would care to look in any time
after six I shall be pleased to see you and to let you
know the result of my journey.
</p>

<p class="quote">
  "I am,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours sincerely,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"JAMES MARSDEN."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With considerable satisfaction Colin folded the
letter and put it away in his pocket.  It was a relief
to know that things were moving at last, for, even if
Kennedy were unable to throw any direct light on the
murder, the information he could supply with regard
to the Professor's private life might well be the
starting-point for further discoveries.
</p>

<p>
He was pondering over the possibilities of the
situation when Martha Jane arrived with his tea.  She
had evidently accepted her appointment as Nancy's
understudy in a serious spirit, for she not only filled
his cup, but stood by with watchful solicitude until she
was certain that he was provided with everything that
he required.
</p>

<p>
Just as she was turning to leave the room there came
a ring at the bell.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if that's our friend Joe Bates," said
Colin.  "If it is, bring him in at once."
</p>

<p>
There was an interval of nearly a minute, and then,
looking rather flushed and ruffled, Martha Jane
reappeared, closing the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't 'im," she announced; "it's a patient.  'E's
waiting outside."  She nodded toward the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang it all!" exclaimed Colin.  "This is my
hour off.  I'm not going to see any more patients until
six.  Why on earth didn't you tell him?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell 'im!" repeated Martha Jane indignantly.  "I
told 'im right enough."
</p>

<p>
"And do you mean to say he won't go away?"
</p>

<p>
"'E just pushed me on one side and sat himself
down," was the answer.  "'E says 'e means to wait
'ere until you come out."
</p>

<p>
Colin rose to his feet, and, swiftly crossing the room,
threw open the door.
</p>

<p>
A man who was seated on one of the hall chairs
jumped up at his appearance.  He was a rough-looking
customer of the longshoreman type, with a deep scar
on one side of his face and a dirty handkerchief
knotted round his neck.
</p>

<p>
Colin walked up to him.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by forcing your way into the
house?" he demanded.  "If you want to see me you
can go round to the surgery and wait until it's open."
</p>

<p>
The intruder stood his ground, fumbling awkwardly
with his cap.
</p>

<p>
"No offence, doctor," he muttered.  "If I done
wrong I asks yer pardon."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you heard what I said," returned Colin.
"There's the door behind you."
</p>

<p>
The man still made no attempt to move.  "Don't
be 'ard, doctor," he said hoarsely.  "I want yer to
come along and see a pal o' mine, a pore bloke wot's
'ad a haccident dahn at Truscott's wharf."
</p>

<p>
Colin shook his head.  "I can't manage it now," he
said.  "I've got to be here at six to see my patients."
</p>

<p>
"You can be back before then, doctor," persisted
the other eagerly.  "It's only a step from 'ere&mdash;s'elp
me Gawd, it is."
</p>

<p>
"I know the place," said Colin.  "It will take a
good twenty minutes to get there."
</p>

<p>
"'E ain't on the wharf now," explained the other.
"We've carried 'im along to 'is own 'ouse."
</p>

<p>
"Where's that?" demanded Colin.
</p>

<p>
The man hesitated.  "It's dahn at the bottom o'
Flood Lane.  One o' them old 'ouses backin' on the
river."
</p>

<p>
Colin recognized the spot from his description&mdash;a
ruinous and half-deserted slum, most of which had
already been demolished.  Before he could speak,
however, the visitor resumed his petition.
</p>

<p>
"For Gawd's sake come along an' 'ave a look at 'im,
guv'nor.  We can't find no other doctor, an' 'e's
sufferin' somethin' crool."
</p>

<p>
Colin glanced at his watch.  "Oh, very well," he
said curtly.  "I sha'n't have time to attend to the man
properly, but if I find it's a matter for surgical
treatment I'll give you a note to the hospital.  Just wait
here and I'll be with you in a minute."
</p>

<p>
He stepped back into the consulting room, and,
crossing to the opposite door, summoned Martha
Jane.
</p>

<p>
"When Miss Nancy comes in," he said, "you might
tell her that I've been called out on an urgent case.
I'm only going as far as the bottom of Flood Lane, so
I shall be back by six."
</p>

<p>
He thrust one or two articles which might be
needed into his bag, and, hurrying out again into the
hall, unhooked his hat and coat.
</p>

<p>
"What sort of injury is it?" he asked, as the front
door closed behind them.  "A broken leg or something
of that kind?"
</p>

<p>
His companion, who was slightly ahead of him,
pushed open the small iron gate and turned to the left
in the direction of the river.
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered slowly, "'e ain't broke
nothing&mdash;leastways, not as I knows of.  The pain's inside
of 'im, so 'e says.  Twisted 'is guts, I reckon, from
the way 'e's carryin' on."
</p>

<p>
He relapsed into silence, and, checking his pace a
few yards farther on, led the way down a dark and
narrow alley.
</p>

<p>
They emerged on to a desolate strip of waste land,
where stray piles of brick and other refuse were
dotted about forlornly under the light of a solitary
street lamp.  Exactly opposite them were the partly
demolished remains of a large warehouse, with two
crazy and tumble-down houses still standing alongside.
Behind these, half a mile wide, ran the dark
and sluggish current of the Thames.
</p>

<p>
Colin's guide pointed across toward the dilapidated
dwellings.
</p>

<p>
"That's the 'ouse," he observed, "the end one o'
them two.  You want to step careful, doctor; there's
a number o' bad places abaht 'ere."
</p>

<p>
He set forward again, picking his way deliberately
between the heaps of débris and the numerous pools
of dirty water which infested the whole district.
Colin followed close behind him, and after several
minutes of this unpleasant progress they came out
on to a muddy and deserted roadway which ran
parallel with the river.
</p>

<p>
Colin glanced back over the route they had come.
"A nice open situation," he remarked, "but I should
think that the people who lived here were rather apt
to break their necks."
</p>

<p>
"It's an orkard spot to get to in the dark," admitted
his companion.  "You'll be all right though, doctor.
I'll see yer back meself as far as Flood Lane."
</p>

<p>
He crossed the road and advanced toward the
houses, one of which appeared to be uninhabited.  A
dim light was burning on the ground floor of the
second, and, mounting the broken step, he rapped twice
on the door with his knuckles.
</p>

<p>
After some delay it was opened by a gaunt,
haggard-looking woman, who held up the candle she was
carrying and peered suspiciously into the darkness.
She evidently recognized the visitor, for without
inquiring his business she stepped back silently against
the wall.
</p>

<p>
"That's 'is wife," observed the man, turning to
Colin.  "She's a bit queer in the 'ead, so you won't
get nothing out of 'er."
</p>

<p>
He moved aside to make room for Colin's entrance,
and then, closing the door behind them, addressed
himself to the woman.
</p>

<p>
With a furtive nod she started off along the passage,
at the end of which there was another room facing
the front door.
</p>

<p>
Colin, who had turned to follow her, took a pace
forward.  It was only one pace, for as his foot touched
the ground something soft and heavy came down with
a blinding thud on the back of his head.  Half
stunned by the blow, he pitched forward full length
on to the rough and uncarpeted boards, and at the
same instant two men sprang forward out of the
room, and flung themselves heavily on top of him.
</p>

<p>
What happened during the next few minutes seemed
to belong to the world of nightmare.  He had a vague
impression of fighting desperately with fists and teeth
and feet; then a savage hand gripped him by the
throat, and everything was wiped out in a sudden and
suffocating blackness.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"I tell yer I knows 'im.  It's the swine that was
'elpin' the cops when they pulled 'Ginger Dick.'"
</p>

<p>
The hoarse voice, which sounded very far away,
penetrated slowly into Colin's mind, and, opening
his eyes, he stared up at the speaker.
</p>

<p>
He was still in the passage, stretched out flat on his
back, with his ankles tied together and his arms bound
tightly to his sides.  Three men were standing round
him, and, in spite of the dim light and the almost
stupefying pain in his head, he had no difficulty in
recognizing them.  The bloodstained face that was
scowling at him had been engraved on his memory
ever since the day when he first met Nancy.  It
belonged to the ruffian who had led the attack on
Marsden and had kicked him in the ribs when he was lying
helpless on the ground.  The other two were the
plausible visitor to the surgery and Mr. "Spike"
Cooper.
</p>

<p>
It was the latter who replied to the first man's outburst.
</p>

<p>
"What the hell's that got to do with it, anyway?"
he drawled.  "I'm here on business, and it don't
matter a cuss to me whether he's your long-lost brother."
</p>

<p>
"It matters to me though," growled the other.  "I
'ad somethin' up against 'im before, an' now 'e's
bashed 'alf me faice in with 'is blarsted boot.  Taike
that, yer swine!"
</p>

<p>
He lifted his foot, but before he could accomplish
his genial purpose a violent shove from "Spike" Cooper
sent him staggering against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"None o' that, you fool!  Didn't you hear what
the boss said?  If there's any marks on his body we
don't get the money."  He turned to the man with
the scar, who had watched the fracas with cynical
indifference.  "No good messing about, Jake.  Catch
hold of his feet and we'll cart him down straight
away."
</p>

<p>
Suiting the action to the word, the two of them
raised him quickly from the floor and carried him
forward through the open doorway.  With a muttered
oath the third accomplice pulled himself together and
lurched in after them.
</p>

<p>
All effective resistance being out of the question
Colin made no attempt to struggle or cry out.  He
felt certain that death was very close at hand, and his
whole being was racked with a sick fury as he thought
of the easy way in which he had allowed himself to
be trapped.
</p>

<p>
Through his half-closed eyes he saw that the room
which they had entered was in a state of indescribable
filth.  The floor was littered with empty bottles and
old newspapers, the damp plaster was peeling off the
bare walls, and the small window, which apparently
looked out on to the river, was thickly coated with
grime.
</p>

<p>
In the left-hand corner the raised flap of a trapdoor
was just visible in the gloom.  His two bearers dropped
him unceremoniously on the boards alongside, and
with a curt air of authority "Spike" Cooper jerked
his thumb toward the hole.
</p>

<p>
"You get down first, Jake," he said, "and we'll
lower him through."
</p>

<p>
Jake accepted the order without comment, and,
swinging himself into the opening, began slowly
disappearing from view down the rungs of a rusty iron
ladder.
</p>

<p>
A moment later there came a muffled voice from
below.
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, mate."
</p>

<p>
Dragging Colin's feet toward the edge, the other
two men jerked him roughly from the ground.  The
next instant his legs were dangling in space, and with
the iron rungs bumping against his back he slid rapidly
down into the darkness below.
</p>

<p>
Just before he reached the bottom he felt himself
clutched round the waist by a pair of strong arms.
Then he was lifted clear of the ladder, and dumped
heavily on to a damp stone floor.
</p>

<p>
After a brief interval "Spike" Cooper also descended,
and, producing an electric torch, switched on
the light.  Colin saw that they were in a large cellar,
the walls of which were dripping with wet slime.
Except for the trapdoor there appeared to be only one
other opening&mdash;a heavily barred grating some eight
feet from the floor.
</p>

<p>
Bending down over his prisoner, "Spike" Cooper
flashed the light full in his face.
</p>

<p>
"That was a dandy fight of yours, mister," he
drawled slowly, "and I'm real sorry we got to put
you through it."
</p>

<p>
Colin looked up at him unflinchingly.  "You seem
to take a long time about committing a murder," he
said.  "Why don't you finish the job and clear out?"
</p>

<p>
The other shook his head.  "That's just the
trouble," he replied, with a touch of regret in his
voice.  "In order to suit the party that's arranging
this little affair you got to be found drowned&mdash;picked
out of the Thames.  See, mister?"
</p>

<p>
Colin glanced round, and in a sudden flash the real
meaning of the dripping walls became hideously
apparent.  With a strong effort he managed to control
his voice.
</p>

<p>
"So that's your plan, is it?" he said.  "I'm to be
left here until the cellar's flooded?"
</p>

<p>
"Spike" Cooper nodded.  "It's a dog's trick," he
admitted reluctantly, "but I guess you'll find it as
easy a death as any other.  Soon as the water's up
level with that grating it pours in here like a
Gawd-damned Niagara."  He paused.  "What I'm buckin'
up against," he continued, "is your having to lie here a
couple of hours waiting for the tide.  Seems to be
kinder cruel, that."
</p>

<p>
In spite of the grim prospect in front of him, Colin
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much," he replied.  "I hope that
when you're hanged death will be instantaneous."
</p>

<p>
They were interrupted by an impatient movement
from the other man.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Spike," he growled.  "Wot the hell's
the use o' standin' 'ere jawin'?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess you're about right," was Mr. Cooper's
philosophical answer.
</p>

<p>
He bent forward once more, and, having satisfied
himself that the cords were properly fastened, turned
to follow his companion, who was already halfway
up the ladder.
</p>

<p>
Colin watched them disappear through the opening
above, then the trapdoor closed down, leaving him
in complete darkness.
</p>

<p>
A moment later he heard a grinding clang as a
rusty bolt shot home into its socket.

<h3>
CHAPTER EIGHT
</h3>

<p>
The study clock chimed out the hour of seven, and,
laying aside the paper she had been looking at, Nancy
got up from her chair and walked to the window.
She drew back the blind, and stood there for a minute
gazing down at, the lighted pavements, where the
usual throng of poorly dressed women were drifting
to and fro, intent upon their evening shopping.  Then
with a puzzled and rather anxious expression in her
face she turned toward the door, and, descending
the staircase, made her way along the passage as far
as the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
She found Martha Jane standing at the sink, peeling
potatoes.
</p>

<p>
"I can't think what can have happened to Doctor
Gray, Martha," she said.  "I'm really beginning to
get worried about him."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you upset yerself, miss," was the reassuring
answer.  "'E'll be along safe enough in a minute or
two."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," said Nancy.  "All the same, it seems
rather extraordinary.  You tell me he said he'd be
home by six, and here it is just gone seven."
</p>

<p>
"You can't pay no 'eed to what doctors say," began
Martha Jane.  "Not that they ain't as truthful as
other gentlemen, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She was interrupted by a ring at the back-door bell,
and, wiping her hands on her apron, departed to
answer the summons.  Nancy heard the low rumble
of a man's voice, followed almost immediately by the
sound of returning footsteps.
</p>

<p>
"It's the same party that called before, Miss Nancy.
A man of the name of Bates.  The doctor said he
wanted to see 'im special, so I s'pose I'd better ask
'im to wait."
</p>

<p>
"What, Joe Bates the prize-fighter?" exclaimed
Nancy.  "Oh, please bring him in at once.  He's the
very person I should like to have a talk to."
</p>

<p>
Martha Jane disappeared again into the scullery,
and a moment later a burly figure in a cap and muffler
followed her diffidently into the light.
</p>

<p>
Nancy welcomed him with an encouraging smile.
</p>

<p>
"We have met before, Mr. Bates," she said.  "I
don't suppose you remember, but it was one night
in Whitcomb Street, when I was in the car with Doctor
Ashton."
</p>

<p>
Joe grinned a trifle nervously.  "That's right, miss,"
he observed.  "I ain't forgot yer&mdash;not me."  He
pulled off his cap and scratched the back of his closely
cropped head.  "I got a bit o' noos for the doctor,"
he continued.  "D'you happen to know when 'e's likely
to be in, miss?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the very point we were talking about,"
replied Nancy.  "He went out at half-past five and he
left a message that he would be back by six at the
latest."
</p>

<p>
Joe stared at her.  "Well, that's a bit queer," he
remarked.  "'E ain't the sort to say a thing and
then not do it."
</p>

<p>
"It's queerer than it looks," was Nancy's answer.
"Six o'clock is the time at which he sees his outdoor
patients.  He wouldn't forget that, however busy he
was."
</p>

<p>
"Did 'e tell yer where 'e was goin' to?"
</p>

<p>
"He told me," broke in Martha Jane.  "Some
'ouse down at the bottom of Flood Lane."
</p>

<p>
A swift change manifested itself in Joe's face.
"Flood Lane!" he almost shouted.  "You're sure 'e
said Flood Lane?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am.  I ain't deaf, Mr. Bates."
</p>

<p>
Joe took no notice of the snub.  "Wot made 'im
go there?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"'E was fetched," replied Martha Jane with some
asperity.  "Fetched by a party who hadn't no better
manners&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"'Ere," interrupted Joe, "wot was the bloke like?
You answer me quick."
</p>

<p>
Martha Jane flushed indignantly, but before her lips
could frame a protest she was forestalled by Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Martha.  Mr. Bates is afraid that
something may have happened to Doctor Gray, and he
wants to help us.  That's so, isn't it?"  She turned
quickly to Joe, who nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"Well," replied Martha Jane, in a slightly mollified
voice, "'e was just a rough common-looking man the
same as you can see 'anging about the street corners
I'd know 'im anywhere, though, if only by the scar
on 'is face."
</p>

<p>
There was a half-stifled oath from Joe.  "Jake
'Udson!" he cried.  "Jake 'Udson it was for a
million!"  He clenched his fists and glared savagely at
the two women.  "Nah ye can see why he ain't come
back."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's heart was beating swiftly, but to all
outward appearance she remained perfectly cool.
</p>

<p>
"Don't waste time," she said.  "Tell me what you
mean at once.  I know that you're a friend of Doctor
Gray's, and I know that he asked you to follow a man
outside the station."
</p>

<p>
Joe moistened his lips.  "That's it, miss.  A bloke
of the name o' 'Spike' Cooper.  'E's 'and an' glove
with this 'ere Jake 'Udson, an' there ain't two dirtier
blackguards, not in the 'ole o' London."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's face had gone very white.  "Do you know
this place&mdash;Flood Lane?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"It's where 'Spike' Cooper's lodgin'," was the
answer.  "Leastways, not Flood Lane itself, but dahn
in one o' them old 'ouses backin' on the river.  I seen
'im go in there twice with me own eyes."  He pulled
on his cap and half turned toward the door.  "I'll
get inside some'ow, miss.  I'll learn wot they done
to the doctor if I got to pull the blarsted place
down."
</p>

<p>
Nancy stepped forward.  "Wait a minute," she
said quickly.  "I'm coming with you."
</p>

<p>
Joe turned and stared at her incredulously.  "You
comin' with me?" he repeated.  "Why, wot'd be the
good o' that, miss?"
</p>

<p>
"I can use a revolver," said Nancy curtly, "and
there's one upstairs in the doctor's room.  You stop
here while I fetch it."
</p>

<p>
There was something so imperative in her manner
that Joe attempted no further argument.  Removing
his cap again, he seated himself obediently on a chair,
and, leaving him and Martha Jane to keep each other
company, Nancy hurried from the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Going straight to the cloak room, she slipped on a
mackintosh over her indoor costume and, after rapidly
donning a hat, ran up the staircase to the study.  From
the top drawer of the writing table she took out a
small Service revolver which Mark had once exhibited
to her with some pride as the actual implement with
which he had formerly waged war against the Flanders
rats.  There was a box of cartridges alongside, and
after filling all six chambers she thrust the weapon
into her pocket, and swiftly made her way downstairs
again to the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Joe, who was still sitting where she had left him,
rose up at her entrance.  It was Martha Jane,
however, who was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
"You can't go off like this, Miss Nancy," she
exclaimed.  "Let me fetch a policeman to come with
you."
</p>

<p>
Nancy shook her head.  "There's no time for
that," she replied.  "Besides, what can we possibly
say to a policeman?  If we tried to explain he'd only
think we were mad."
</p>

<p>
"You're right, miss," broke in Joe.  "This 'ere's
a job wot's got to be done quick, an' the sooner we
get to it the better."
</p>

<p>
"Come along then," returned Nancy.  "I'm ready."
</p>

<p>
She led the way out through the scullery door and,
pulling open the iron gate, turned to Joe, who had
followed closely on her heels.
</p>

<p>
"You give the orders," she said, "and I'll do whatever
you tell me."
</p>

<p>
The light of the street lamp was shining full upon
her face, and Joe paused for a moment to inspect her
admiringly.
</p>

<p>
"You got some sense, you 'ave," he observed, "and
guts too."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," said Nancy.  "Anyhow, I've got the
revolver, and that seems to me to be almost as useful."
</p>

<p>
With a chuckle Joe swung on to the pavement, and,
turning to the left, headed eastward in the direction
of Flood Lane.
</p>

<p>
"It's this way, miss," he continued, after a short
pause.  "Seein' as 'ow we're workin' in the dark in a
manner o' speakin,' it ain't no use makin' plans, not
till we reach the 'ouse.  The first thing we gotter do
is to get inside.  It don't sound like an easy job, but
then, yer never knows."
</p>

<p>
"How many of them do you think there are?"
asked Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"I bin watchin' the place for two days, an' I ain't
seen no one except 'Spike' Cooper an' this 'ere Jake
'Udson.  I reckon I can 'andle them easy enough so
long as they don't start usin' their knives.  If they
does&mdash;well, that's where that gun o' yourn may come
in 'andy."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I give it to you?" suggested Nancy.
</p>

<p>
Joe shook his head.  "No," he replied.  "I likes
to 'ave me 'ands free.  You stick to it, miss, but don't
you begin pluggin' 'oles in 'em, not unless I tips you
the orfice.  We don't want no inquests, not if we can
get 'old of the doctor withaht."
</p>

<p>
They turned into Flood Lane and, passing rapidly
down the narrow and evil-smelling thoroughfare,
emerged on the broad stretch of waste land that
bordered the river bank.
</p>

<p>
"That's where we gotter go to," said Joe, pointing
across to the black outline of the warehouse.  "There's
a way over right enough, but I guess we'd better stick
to the road.  If any one 'appens to be looking out
they're less likely to see us."
</p>

<p>
He struck off to the right, and, keeping well under
the shadow of the opposite wall, guided Nancy
cautiously forward until they reached the muddy road
which ran parallel with the river.  Crossing this, he
gained the broken pavement on the farther side, and
continued his advance until they were within a few
yards of the warehouse.
</p>

<p>
"It's the second 'ouse you come to from 'ere," he
whispered.  "I bin thinkin' it over, an' if you ain't
afraid, miss, it seems to me the best plan's for you to
go on a'ead, an' knock at the door.  If they sees
you alone they may open it jest to find out wot yer
after."
</p>

<p>
"What shall I say?" inquired Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you say nothin'.  I'll be 'anging arahnd
close be'ind, and before they shuts it again I'll 'ave me
foot inside.  We'll do the talkin' then."
</p>

<p>
Nancy nodded, to show that she understood, and,
walking on bravely through the gloom, pulled up in
front of the suspected dwelling.  A glimmer of light
in the front room revealed the presence of a dilapidated
knocker.  She drew in a long breath, which
seemed to steady her throbbing heart, and then,
stepping forward, gave a couple of sharp raps.
</p>

<p>
Almost at once she became conscious that someone
was inspecting her from inside the window.  The
scrutiny must have lasted for several seconds, then the
face was suddenly withdrawn, and a moment later she
could hear the approach of shuffling footsteps.
</p>

<p>
After another pause the door began to open.  It
went back slowly until there was a space of about
six inches, and through the gap a pair of suspicious
eyes peered out at the visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Well," demanded a croaking voice, "wot d'yer
want 'ere?"
</p>

<p>
Even if Nancy had been prepared with a reply she
would have had no time to deliver it.  Silently as a
tiger Joe leaped forward out of the darkness, and,
bringing every ounce of his weight to bear at the right
moment, hurled himself against the panel.  There was
a shrill cry and the sound of a heavy fall as the door
crashed inward, then Nancy found herself clutching
the railings and staring at the vague outline of two
figures who seemed to be scuffling furiously on the floor
of the passage.
</p>

<p>
She was recalled to action by the voice of Joe.
</p>

<p>
"I got 'er," he gasped triumphantly.  "Come along
in, miss, an' shut the door."
</p>

<p>
Snatching out her revolver, Nancy stepped across
the threshold, and with commendable coolness
proceeded to carry out his instructions.  The task only
occupied her a moment, but by the time she had finished,
Joe was on his feet again, swearing softly to himself
and sucking vigorously at his left thumb.  "Bit me
to the bone, the 'ell-cat," he observed.  "And I
'andled 'er gently, too, jest 'cos she 'appened to be a
woman."  He paused, and, bending forward, listened
intently.  "Darned if it don't seem as if she was alone
in the 'ouse," he added.
</p>

<p>
Nancy advanced to where he was standing, and in
the flickering candle-light which came out through the
open door of the room looked down at the prostrate
figure on the ground.  It was that of a gaunt,
middle-aged woman, clad in a dirty dressing gown, with
dishevelled hair streaming over her face and neck.  A
rolled-up handkerchief had been thrust into her mouth,
and her wrists were tied together by the scarf which
had formerly decorated Joe's neck.  Out of her bloodshot
eyes she glared up malevolently at the pair of
them.
</p>

<p>
Nancy drew back with a shudder.  "I hope she
isn't much hurt," she faltered.
</p>

<p>
"'Urt?" repeated Joe indignantly.  "It's me wot's
'urt, not 'er.  Got 'er teeth in while I was tyin' 'er up
an' 'alf gnawed me blinkin' thumb off!"  He rummaged
in his pocket, and, after a moment's search,
produced a stray length of cord.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" asked Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Tack her feet together and lock 'er in the room,"
was the answer.  "I'm goin' over this 'ouse from top
to bottom, an'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look!  Look!"  With a horrified expression in
her face Nancy was pointing down toward the floor.
Joe's eyes followed the direction of her finger, and a
sudden oath escaped his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Blood!" he cried.  "An' wet blood, too!"
</p>

<p>
He stepped into the room, and, snatching up the
candlestick from the table, hurried back with it into
the passage.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see?" whispered Nancy.  "There's a trail
of it&mdash;all along up to the door."  She put her hand to
her breast and fought back the numbing fear that
seemed to be clutching at her heart.
</p>

<p>
With blazing eyes Joe turned on the prostrate
woman.
</p>

<p>
"You she-devil!" he roared, shaking his fist.  "If
any 'arm's come to the doctor through you an' your
filthy mates, I'll rip the skin off all three of yer."
</p>

<p>
Before the word had left his lips Nancy was already
at the farther door.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, Joe!" she cried piteously.  "Quick!  Bring
the candle."
</p>

<p>
In two strides the prize-fighter was beside her.
</p>

<p>
"You stand back," he commanded hoarsely, and,
thrusting the candlestick into her hands, gripped hold
of the knob.
</p>

<p>
As the door swung open Nancy raised the light.
Its faint gleam flickered round the sordid room,
disclosing the damp and peeling wallpaper and litter of
empty whisky bottles which lay about the floor.
</p>

<p>
Joe's glance travelled swiftly from one corner to
another.  "There's no one 'ere," he muttered.  "We'd
best try the floor above."
</p>

<p>
Nancy caught him by the sleeve. "Listen," she
cried tensely.  "What's that?"
</p>

<p>
From below came an unmistakable sound&mdash;the
steady but muffled splash of running water.
</p>

<p>
For a second they both stood there motionless, then,
with a sudden exclamation, Nancy pushed her way
past and stumbled blindly forward toward the trap-door.
</p>

<p>
"Joe," she gasped, "he's down there!  I know it.
I feel it."  She sank on her knees, and setting the
candle on the floor beside her, began tugging
desperately at the iron bolt.
</p>

<p>
Recovering from his momentary amazement, Joe
hurried to her assistance.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere," he growled, "let me get at it."
</p>

<p>
He seized hold of the rusty stanchion, and with a
vicious jerk wrenched it backward.  Another heave
and the heavy flap rose slowly into the air, revealing
a black, yawning gap and the top rungs of an iron
ladder.
</p>

<p>
Stretched out at full length on her face, Nancy
thrust the candle over the edge.  The light gleamed
upon a rush and eddy of chocolate-coloured water, and
then suddenly a frantic cry broke from her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Colin!  Colin!"
</p>

<p>
With a violent imprecation Joe pushed her on one
side.
</p>

<p>
"'Old on," he roared down the trap.  "I'm comin'."
</p>

<p>
He swung himself through, and dropping with a
loud splash into the swirling waters, scrambled
desperately toward the opposite corner, where a man's
head and shoulders were just visible in the gloom.
Another minute and he would have been too late, for
even as he reached the spot a fresh torrent surged in
through the opening, and with a choking sob Colin
swayed forward and collapsed.
</p>

<p>
Keeping his own feet with difficulty, Joe clutched
hold of the drowning man and dragged him to the
surface.  In doing so he made the discovery that
Colin's arms were lashed to his sides, and the full
nature of the task that confronted him flashed grimly
across his mind.
</p>

<p>
As a veteran boxer, however, the power to think
quickly and coolly in moments of danger had practically
become an instinct.  He realized instantly that
there was only one chance of escape for both of them,
and that was to cut through the cords before the
incoming water rose above their heads.
</p>

<p>
Swinging his half-conscious companion round, he
propped him against the wall.  Then, freeing one
hand, he dragged out the clasp-knife which he always
carried in his pocket, and wrenched open the blade
with his teeth.
</p>

<p>
As he did so, Colin by great effort managed to
force a few words from between his chattering
teeth.
</p>

<p>
"There's another on&mdash;round my feet.  Cut that
too if you can."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are!" shouted Joe encouragingly.
"Keep it up, doctor, and I'll 'ave you loose in a couple
o' shakes."
</p>

<p>
With feverish haste he accomplished the first part
of his task, and then, taking a deep breath, plunged
his way down through the water until his fingers
encountered the second cord.  One vicious slash severed
the wet strand, and, uncoiling it as rapidly as he could,
he struggled back to the surface, puffing and gasping
for air.
</p>

<p>
Quick as he had been, there was scarcely a second to
spare.  The water was already up to his chin, and
Colin, although his legs and arms were now free, was
far too numbed and exhausted to make more than the
feeblest efforts on his own behalf.
</p>

<p>
Summoning every ounce of his strength, Joe lifted
the latter bodily in his arms.  Then with swaying
steps he stumbled forward in the direction of the
trapdoor, where the little yellow flame of the candle
which Nancy was holding flickered and gleamed above
their heads.
</p>

<p>
"Get 'old of the ladder, guv'nor," he panted.  "Get
'old of it some'ow and I'll shove yer up."
</p>

<p>
Colin heard, and with blue and stiffened fingers
caught desperately at the rungs.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment he glanced up toward the
trap, and there, sharply illuminated in the
candle-light, he saw Nancy's face bending down toward him.
</p>

<p>
With something between a sob and a laugh she
stretched out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Stop as you are now," came Joe's voice.  "I'm
goin' to stoop down so as you can get on top of me.
All you've gotter do is to keep yerself stiff."
</p>

<p>
There was a splash, and a second later Colin's
ankles were encircled in a powerful grip.  Then his
feet were resting on Joe's shoulders, and inch by inch
he felt himself hoisted upward, until Nancy's fingers
closed tightly round his wrists.
</p>

<p>
Another heave from below and the upper half of
his body was through the trap.  He thrust out a hand
to steady himself, and as he did so a sudden wave of
giddiness overcame him, and he sank sideways into
Nancy's arms.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER NINE
</h3>

<p>
"Colin, Colin dear!  It's all over.  You're safe up
here with us."
</p>

<p>
He opened his eyes, to find his head resting upon
Nancy's shoulder, and the dripping figure of Joe just
emerging through the trap.  For a moment he made
no attempt to move, then, as the truth of the statement
became increasingly clear to him, a contented
sigh escaped his lips.
</p>

<p>
Nancy drew him still closer, her soft cheek pressing
against his.  "Are you much hurt?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Though feeling curiously disinclined for conversation,
Colin managed to find his voice.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so," he said weakly.  "What I
really want is a good stiff drink."
</p>

<p>
Joe, who had stepped out on the floor, and picked
up the candle, glanced hastily round the room, then
with a sudden exclamation he darted across toward
a shelf by the bed.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere we are!" he cried triumphantly.  "'Ere's
the very thing!"
</p>

<p>
He wrenched out the cork from a half-empty bottle
of rum, and hurrying back to where Colin was lying,
dropped down on one knee alongside of him.
</p>

<p>
"'Ave a go at this, doctor," he urged.  "Nothing
like rum to warm yer up when you're wet through."
</p>

<p>
He tilted forward the bottle, and, putting his lips
to the neck, Colin gulped in a generous mouthful.  The
raw spirit sent a comforting glow all through his
chilled and exhausted body, and with a fresh effort he
struggled up into a sitting position.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you both," he gasped, with the ghost of a
smile.  "Sorry not to have said it before, but I'm
only just beginning to get my bearings."  He stared a
little dizzily from one to the other of them.  "Where
are 'Spike' Cooper and his friends, and how in the
name of all that's wonderful did you manage to find
your way here?"
</p>

<p>
"It was Joe," said Nancy.  "He had been watching
this house for the last two days, and he had seen
them go in and out.  When you didn't come back he
felt sure you must have been trapped."
</p>

<p>
"So we just come along to see wot was 'appening,"
continued Joe, removing his mouth from the bottle.
"And bleedin' lucky we did, too, judgin' by the way
things was shapin'."
</p>

<p>
Colin passed his hand over his forehead.  "But
how did you get in?" he asked.  "What have you
done with the others?"
</p>

<p>
"There wasn't no others," explained Joe.  "Only a
bitin', scratchin' she-devil."  He got up suddenly, and,
tiptoeing lightly to the door, peered out into the
passage.  "Yus," he added, "she's still there, blarst 'er."
</p>

<p>
"It's the old woman who opened the door," explained
Nancy.  "Joe tied her up and gagged her so
that she shouldn't be able to interfere.  There doesn't
seem to be any one else in the house."
</p>

<p>
"Then the quicker we get out of this the better,"
exclaimed Colin.  "They've probably only gone round
to the nearest pub, and now the cellar's flooded they
may be back any minute."
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," said Nancy.  "I've got Mark's
pistol with me."
</p>

<p>
"You would have," returned Colin admiringly.
"All the same, it would be madness not to make a bolt
for it while we've got the chance.  We shall have
plenty of time to talk when we're safe outside."  He
extended an arm to each of them, and with their joint
assistance scrambled painfully to his feet.  "You'll
have to help me along at first," he added; "my legs
are so cramped I can hardly move a step."
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid they'd killed you," said Nancy, with
a queer little gulp.  "There was blood all along the
passage."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that wasn't mine," returned Colin reassuringly.
"That belonged to one of the other gentlemen whom
I happened to kick in the face."
</p>

<p>
"We may as well taike this with us," observed Joe,
stuffing the remainder of the rum into his pocket.
"Nah, doctor, you 'ang on tight to me, an' don't you
worry yerself abaht nothin'.  We ain't bein' stopped
this journey, not if we runs into the 'ole stinkin' pack
of 'em."
</p>

<p>
He slipped an arm like a steel cable round Colin's
waist, and, preceded by Nancy carrying the candle,
they staggered out into the corridor.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you mind treadin' on 'er," continued Joe,
as they approached the squirming figure on the floor.
"She's one o' them wild cats that it don't pay to be
perlite with."
</p>

<p>
Colin himself was in no mood for superfluous
courtesy, but a timely swerve enabled him to avoid
the opposite extreme, and the next minute they had
hobbled down the steps, and were standing on the
pavement.
</p>

<p>
Blowing out the candle, and placing it on the
ground, Nancy closed the door behind them.
</p>

<p>
Joe held out his free hand toward her.  "Better
let me 'ave the gun, miss," he remarked.  "We might
meet 'em before we gets to Flood Lane, and, seein'
as they means mischief, the only thing to do is to
shoot quick."
</p>

<p>
Nancy handed it over without a word, and, crossing
to the railings, took up her position on the farther
side of Colin.  The latter put his other arm round her
shoulder, and in this somewhat huddled formation
the three of them started off at a slow pace along the
front of the warehouse.
</p>

<p>
It was a painful journey as far as Colin was
concerned, for with every step he took the blood began
to circulate more freely through his numbed limbs,
causing him such intense agony that at times he could
hardly suppress a groan.
</p>

<p>
In order to take his mind off his sufferings he began
to tell them his story, jerking it out in broken and
disconnected phrases as they limped their way slowly
forward through the darkness.  He described how he
had been stunned in the passage by a blow from a
sandbag, and how, on coming round, he had recognized
"Spike" Cooper and the man who had led the attack
on Marsden in the King's Road.  He went on to give
them an account of the way in which he had been thrust
down into the cellar and left there to drown, and of
how, after what seemed like hours of vain struggling,
he had at last succeeded in getting on his feet, just
before the water began to pour in through the opening.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why I took the trouble," he finished,
"except that one doesn't like to go under without a last
kick.  I never dreamed that there was the faintest
chance of my being rescued.  When I heard you opening
the trap I made certain that it was only Cooper and
the others come back to watch me drown."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke they reached the entrance to Flood
Lane, and with a grunt of relief Joe slipped the
revolver into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Better not be seen carryin' a gun 'ere," he observed.
"There might be a cop at the corner, and I reckon we
want to get you back 'ome as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't worry about me," said Colin
encouragingly.  "This little stroll has just saved my
life."
</p>

<p>
He was, as a matter of fact, already beginning to
walk more easily, and by the time they came out at
the top of the lane into the main road he found
himself able to dispense with Nancy's assistance.
</p>

<p>
Even so, with two of the party drenched to the skin,
they certainly presented an unusual spectacle.  It takes
something extremely out-of-the-way, however, to excite
much comment in Shadwell High Street, and, except
for one or two curious glances which were cast at them
as they passed under the street lamps, they managed
to reach the surgery without attracting any particular
attention.
</p>

<p>
"I expect I can find you a change, Joe," said Colin,
as Nancy pulled out her key.  "Doctor Ashton has lots
of old clothes kicking about, and I'm sure he won't
mind my pinching a suit for you."
</p>

<p>
Joe shook his head.  "It's very good of you,
guv'nor, but I won't come in, not if ye don't mind.
I gotter be at the Palace by eight o'clock, an' I can
get me duds dried there while the boxin's on.  They
won't be none the worse for a bit o' washin'."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you must, Joe," exclaimed Nancy, in some
distress.  "You can't go about in those wet things.
You'll catch your death of cold."
</p>

<p>
Joe chuckled hoarsely, and patted the bottle in his
side pocket.  "Not me, miss," he replied.  "I ain't
the sort as ketches cold, not when I got 'alf a bottle o'
rum on me."  He turned to Colin.  "You ain't sittin'
dahn under this, doctor?" he added.  "You let me
know when ye feels up to it, and I'll be round 'ere
in a brace o' shakes.  We'll smash the guts outer
them two for this night's work, or my name ain't Joe
Bates."
</p>

<p>
"I'll fix up something of the sort if I can," said
Colin hopefully.  "I've got a notion, however, that
it's rather a bigger business than it looks, so you
mustn't be disappointed if we have to bring the
police in."
</p>

<p>
"Jest as you thinks best, guv'nor," was the regretful
answer.  "I know yer wouldn't spoil a bit o' sport,
not if you 'adn't got some good reason for doin' it."
</p>

<p>
He raised his hand in a parting salute, and, before
either of them could say another word, turned swiftly
round and slipped out through the iron gate.
</p>

<p>
"I hope he'll be all right," said Nancy.  "He's
terribly wet, poor man, and that wretched woman bit
his thumb right down to the bone."
</p>

<p>
"That won't worry Joe," replied Colin reassuringly.
"It takes a motor bus to knock him out."
</p>

<p>
He shivered slightly as he spoke, and with a hurried
movement Nancy turned the key and pushed open
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Colin," she said, "you're under my orders.
The first thing you've got to do is to come
straight up and have a hot bath.  Then you must get
into bed at once, and I'll bring you something to
eat."
</p>

<p>
"Make it bread and milk," said Colin pleadingly.
"I've got such a confounded headache I couldn't face
anything more exciting than that."
</p>

<p>
Taking his arm, Nancy helped him up the staircase
to his bedroom, where she lighted the fire and left him
to undress.  Then, after turning on the bath, and
putting everything in readiness, she hastened
downstairs to the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Martha Jane, bursting with curiosity, greeted her
in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"I seed you takin' 'im upstairs, miss.  However did
'e come to fall in the river?"
</p>

<p>
"He didn't," said Nancy.  "He has been nearly
murdered down in one of those old houses by the
warehouse.  They tied him up in a cellar where the
water came in, and left him to drown."
</p>

<p>
Martha Jane threw up her hands.  "Well, I never!"
she exclaimed.  "And 'im such a pleasant-spoken
gentleman, too."  She paused to recover her breath.
"Who do you reckon done it, miss?  Some o' them
Bolsheviks?"
</p>

<p>
"Joe knows who they are," replied Nancy, "and
I've no doubt the police will be able to get hold of
them.  Meanwhile, what we've got to do is to make
Doctor Gray some nice hot bread and milk.  He's having
a bath now, and I'll take it up to him as soon as he's
in bed."  She glanced at the kitchen clock and a
sudden resolve came into her mind.  "I think I'd better
stay here myself, Martha," she added.  "I can easily
sleep in Mrs. Ashton's room, and then I shall be
able to answer the telephone if there are any night
calls."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be thankful to 'ave yer, miss," was the
relieved answer.  "You never know what may
'appen, and if the doctor was to die in 'is bed I
should be that scared I shouldn't know which way to
turn."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there's no fear of that," replied Nancy,
smiling.  "You go along and cut up some bread while I
put the milk on."
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour later, carrying a daintily laid
tray, she mounted the staircase and tapped at Colin's
door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," he called out, and, entering the room,
she found him sitting up in bed and smoking a
cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm pretty well all right now, except for my
head," he replied cheerfully in answer to her inquiry.
"Lucky for me it's a good thick one, or I believe that
chap would have fractured my skull."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to let you talk," said Nancy severely.
"You've got to eat this and go right off to sleep.  I've
arranged to stay here to-night so that you won't have
to bother about the 'phone."
</p>

<p>
"I promise I'll be good," said Colin obediently,
"but there are two things I want to speak to you
about, and they'll neither of them take long."
</p>

<p>
Nancy glanced at her watch.  "I will stop five
minutes," she said, "just while you finish your bread
and milk."
</p>

<p>
She sat down on the edge of the bed and helped
herself to a cigarette from the case which he held
out to her.
</p>

<p>
"In the first place, I've got to apologize for being
an idiot," he began.  "If I'd had the sense to listen
to your warning I shouldn't have given you and Joe
all this confounded trouble."  He dipped his spoon
into the basin and looked at her thoughtfully.  "Well,"
he added, after a pause, "what do you think of our
friend Major Fenton now?"
</p>

<p>
"I think he ought to be shut up in an asylum," said
Nancy.  "Any one who tries to commit a murder for
such a ridiculous reason as me must be as mad as a
hatter."
</p>

<p>
Colin shook his head.  "Fenton isn't mad," he said
quietly.  "He's just an ordinary blackguard, and
rather a clumsy one at that."
</p>

<p>
Nancy stared at him in bewilderment.  "Then
why&mdash;&mdash;" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know if you've ever read Boswell," continued
Colin, "but Doctor Johnson says that it sharpens
a man's wits wonderfully if he's just on the point of
being hanged.  You can take my word for it that the
same thing's true about being drowned.  I did a lot
of thinking while I was down in that cellar, and I've
come to the conclusion that we're up against something
much bigger and more complicated than we've got any
idea of."
</p>

<p>
Nancy sat motionless, her blue eyes fixed steadily
on his.
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite understand," she said slowly, "but I
somehow feel that you're right."
</p>

<p>
"I won't try to explain now," replied Colin.  "My
head's aching too badly for one thing, and in any case
I am going to turn the whole business over to
Marsden to-morrow, and I would rather wait until I hear
what he's got to say about it."  He paused.
"Besides," he added, "I have only another three minutes,
and there's something much more important I want
to discuss."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" inquired Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Come a little closer," said Colin.  "It's confidential."
</p>

<p>
Nancy moved forward obediently, and with a sudden
movement Colin pushed aside the tray and took hold
of her two hands.
</p>

<p>
"It's just this," he whispered.  "I love you so much
that I don't know whether I'm sitting in bed or
whether I've died and gone to heaven."
</p>

<p>
Nancy looked up into his face, a faint smile quivering
round the corners of her lips.
</p>

<p>
"I think you must be in bed, Colin.  They don't
wear pyjamas in heaven."
</p>

<p>
He leaned toward her.  "Say you care for me,
Nancy, even if it isn't true."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "I told you I was no good at
pretending.  I have loved you shamelessly ever since
that first day in the King's Road."
</p>

<p>
With a deep, contented laugh Colin drew up her
hands until they rested on his shoulders.  "So have I,"
he confessed, "but I only realized it while I was waiting
to be drowned.  I think I must be the biggest fool
in England, but I'm certainly the happiest."
</p>

<p>
He kissed her lips with a passionate tenderness, and
then, slipping his arms round her, held her close to
him, his face resting against hers.
</p>

<p>
For a moment or two they remained quite still, then
very gently Nancy raised her head.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know much about concussion, Colin," she
said, "but I'm quite sure that this isn't the right
treatment for it."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't got concussion," returned Colin.  "What
I'm suffering from is an acute form of heart trouble."
</p>

<p>
Nancy stroked his cheek with her small, cool fingers.
</p>

<p>
"My poor darling," she whispered.  "I will do
everything I can for you to-morrow&mdash;I promise you
that&mdash;but I <i>must</i> run away now and let you go to
sleep.  I don't want you to be seriously ill, Colin,
especially when you've just found out that you love me."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you're right," admitted Colin reluctantly.
"The worst of it is we shall have precious little time
to ourselves until Mark comes home, and after that
I shall have to dash up to Scotland Yard."
</p>

<p>
Nancy tucked in the bedclothes, and then, bending
over, dropped a soft little kiss on his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," she said happily.  "There'll be lots
of days after to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
She walked to the doorway, and for a moment stood
there, looking back at him with a world of love and
tenderness in her eyes.  Then very softly she stepped
out into the passage and closed the door behind her.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
When Colin woke next morning it was with a vague
feeling that something extraordinarily pleasant had
happened to him.  For several seconds he lay still,
wondering what it could be; then, as the truth
suddenly occurred to him, he started up from the pillow
and opened his eyes.  Two agreeable discoveries
awaited him.  His headache had gone, and Nancy,
fully dressed and holding a cup of tea in her hand,
was standing beside the bed.
</p>

<p>
"I was just going to take it away again," she said,
smiling.  "You looked so beautifully comfy I hadn't
the heart to wake you."
</p>

<p>
Colin reached out an arm and imprisoned her left
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me quick, Nancy," he said.  "It <i>is</i> true about
last night, isn't it?  I'm terribly afraid that perhaps
I fell asleep and dreamed it all."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "No, Colin," she said.  "It's
quite true.  You sat up in bed and made love to me in
the most passionate manner.  I don't know whether
you really meant it or whether it was because you had
had a blow on the head."
</p>

<p>
Colin leaned forward, and, taking the cup out of
her hand, deposited it carefully on the table beside him.
Then he drew her gently down on to the bed, and,
putting his arms around her, pressed his lips to
hers.
</p>

<p>
"I think you must be better," said Nancy, as soon
as she was at liberty to speak.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not only better," declared Colin.  "I'm
perfectly well.  I believe an occasional smack from a
sandbag would do me all the good in the world."
</p>

<p>
Nancy parted his thick curly hair, and very
carefully examined the back of his head.
</p>

<p>
"You've got a nasty lump there still," she said.
"Hadn't you better stop in bed until Mark comes?"
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, no!" returned Colin.  "I'm going to
get up and do my job.  There'll be all last night's
patients to see as well as to-day's, and I don't want to
land Mark with a double dose of work."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you really mean it," said Nancy.  "I
must go downstairs and get things ready.  I haven't
even opened the letters yet."
</p>

<p>
"Just one more kiss first," pleaded Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Only one, then," said Nancy firmly, "and that
must be the last until this afternoon.  If you don't
treat me with proper respect while I'm your secretary
I shall report you to the Medical Council."
</p>

<p>
For a man who during the last twenty-four hours
had looked straight into the face of death, and had
also discovered that he was deeply in love, it must
be admitted that Colin got through the morning's
task with considerable credit.  It was no light session
either, for, in addition to his ordinary round of visits,
he was faced, as he had predicted, by an exceptionally
heavy list of callers, several of whom were still indignant
over their fruitless vigil on the previous evening.
An occasional glimpse of Nancy, however, as she
gravely entered the surgery with some necessary
reference or address, was sufficient to refresh his energies,
and by one-thirty his somewhat exhausting programme
was practically complete.
</p>

<p>
He was, indeed, in the very act of dismissing his
last patient when a taxicab drove up to the door, and
the sturdy, untidy figure of Mark bundled out on to
the pavement.  Nancy must have seen him, too, from
the study window, for as the front door opened Colin
heard her voice in the hall, and the next moment the
pair of them entered the surgery.
</p>

<p>
Mark thrust out his hand and wrung Colin's
heartily.
</p>

<p>
"I needn't ask how everything is," remarked the
latter.  "You look too damn cheerful for anything
but good news."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," returned Mark, tossing his hat on
to a chair.  "The operation went off like clockwork,
and I left the old lady sitting up in bed having a cup
of tea with Mary.  She'll be as fit as a fiddle in another
fortnight."  He stepped forward to the table and
glanced casually down at the consulting book.  "By
Jove, you've had some patients," he exclaimed.  "I
hope you haven't been bored stiff."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's lips twitched, and, as though moved by a
similar impulse, Colin suddenly burst into a chuckle of
laughter.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied drily, "I can't exactly say I've
been bored."
</p>

<p>
Mark looked questioningly from one to the other
of them.  "What's the joke?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
As he spoke Martha Jane appeared in the doorway.
"Lunch is ready," she announced, "if you'd like me
to bring it up."
</p>

<p>
Colin slipped his arm through Mark's.  "You shall
hear all about it when we've had something to eat,"
he answered.  "I've been healing the sick ever since
half-past nine, and I'm beginning to faint for want of
nourishment."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go along to the cellar and get out a bottle of
fizz," suggested Mark.  "I think you and Nancy are
both entitled to a drink."
</p>

<p>
Once more Colin laughed appreciatively.  "Yes,"
he said, "under the circumstances I suppose we are."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"And now," observed Mark, as he pushed his
coffee cup away half an hour later, "I'd like to know
what you two sunny-hearted infants were giggling at
when I made that innocent remark in the surgery."
</p>

<p>
Colin glanced at Nancy.  "Shall I tell him?" he
asked, "or will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you," said Nancy decisively.  "The police
will want to know all about it, so it's just as well you
should have a rehearsal."
</p>

<p>
"The police!" exclaimed Mark.  "Good heavens,
I hope you haven't been sending out prussic acid in
mistake for magnesia?"
</p>

<p>
"It's worse than that," said Colin cheerfully.
"However, if you hang on tight to your chair and
don't interrupt I think you may be just able to bear
it."  He paused.  "Joking aside, Mark," he added
more seriously, "we seem to have struck something
really ugly in the way of trouble, and I want your
opinion and advice pretty badly."
</p>

<p>
At the sudden change in his voice Mark sobered
down instantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you mean that, my son," he said, "get
on with it at once."
</p>

<p>
"It's chiefly about Nancy's guardian," continued
Colin.  "You remember him, the chap who came to
lunch?"
</p>

<p>
Mark nodded.
</p>

<p>
Going back to their first meeting in Jubilee Place,
Colin began very carefully and deliberately to relate
everything he knew about Major Fenton, of which
Mark was still in ignorance.  He described how the
man had originally forced his society upon Nancy by
pretending to have been acquainted with her father,
and how, on discovering who Colin was, he had
endeavoured to prejudice her mind against him by
inventing that absurd story about a scandal at
St. Christopher's Hospital.  He went on, step by step,
to trace the various developments that had followed&mdash;his
own inquiries at Scotland Yard, Fenton's abortive
proposal to Nancy, his suggestive meeting with
"Spike" Cooper outside the public house, and the
improvised engagement of Joe Bates in the role of an
amateur detective.
</p>

<p>
Having thus cleared the ground, he proceeded to
give a curt account of what had taken place on the
previous evening.  He spoke very quietly and simply,
but the details were dramatic enough in themselves
without any word-painting, and it was easy to see the
profound amazement with which Mark drank in his
story.
</p>

<p>
So thunderstruck, indeed, did the latter appear to
be that nearly a minute must have elapsed after Colin
had finished speaking before he attempted to offer his
first comment.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm blessed!" he exclaimed.  "And they call
this a civilized country!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's civilized enough," returned Colin carelessly.
"If I hadn't been able to get some bread and
milk and a hot bath when I came back I should
probably be down with double pneumonia."  He lighted
another cigarette and leaned inquiringly across the
table.  "Those are the facts, anyhow, Mark.  And
now I'll be much obliged if you'll let me know what
you make of 'em."
</p>

<p>
Mark took off his spectacles and polished them
deliberately with his handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"There's one thing that's perfectly plain," he said.
"The sooner Fenton's in Broadmoor the better for
you and Nancy."
</p>

<p>
"You think he's insane then?"
</p>

<p>
Mark received the question with a stare of astonishment.
"Insane!" he repeated.  "Why, what the devil
else can he be?"
</p>

<p>
"You have seen him yourself," persisted Colin.
"Did you notice anything the least queer about him?"
</p>

<p>
Mark paused.  "No," he said slowly.  "Now you
come to mention it, I'm hanged if I did."
</p>

<p>
"Nor I," was Colin's rejoinder.  "I quite agree
with you that he ought to be shut up, only I think it's
Dartmoor and not Broadmoor."
</p>

<p>
"But, hang it all," broke in Mark, "a sane man
doesn't try to have a perfect stranger murdered just
because he's a little sore at being turned down by a
girl."
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't," admitted Colin.  "There must be
some other reason that we know nothing about, and
that's why I'm going to turn the whole thing over to
Marsden.  If I thought that it was merely a personal
matter between him and me I'd go round and knock
the stuffing out of him myself."
</p>

<p>
Mark replaced his spectacles with an air of
bewilderment that was almost comic.
</p>

<p>
"The more one thinks over it," he said, "the more
incomprehensible it seems.  For one thing, why should
he connect you with Nancy at all?  You have only
seen each other about three times."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Well as far as that goes," replied Colin, "he may
have a better reason than you imagine."
</p>

<p>
Mark glanced at Nancy, who had turned a delicate
shade of pink.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" he exclaimed.  "You don't mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do," replied Colin; "we fixed it up last
night over the bread and milk, and I'm so happy that
I could get up and dance round the room."
</p>

<p>
He stretched out his arm, and taking Nancy's hand
across the table, bent over and kissed the tips of her
fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if that isn't the limit!" ejaculated Mark
bitterly.  "I leave my practice in your hands, trusting
to your honesty, and when I come back I find you've
pinched the one thing I value most&mdash;the only perfect
secretary a doctor ever had."
</p>

<p>
Nancy turned toward him with a startled expression.
"Oh," she cried remorsefully, "I never
knew you'd look at it like that."
</p>

<p>
Mark got up from his chair, and stepping toward
her with a twinkle in his eyes, laid his hand
affectionately on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"My beloved child," he said, "I was only joking.
I shall just hate losing you, and so will Mary, but,
thank God, we're neither of us quite such selfish pigs
as to grudge you the happiness you deserve."
</p>

<p>
He picked up the champagne bottle and tilted the
few remaining drops into his empty glass.
</p>

<p>
"Colin, my lad," he said, "here's my blessing and
my congratulations!  Nancy's a million times too good
for you, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the telephone bell rang sharply, and
Colin, who was sitting nearest the door, jumped to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go," he said.  "You finish your speech, Mark.
It would be a pity to break off just when you're
getting really truthful."
</p>

<p>
He hurried out into the hall and took down the
receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Is that 276 Shadwell?"
</p>

<p>
"It is," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Inspector Marsden of Scotland Yard speaking.
Is Doctor Gray in?"
</p>

<p>
"He's not only in, but he's talking to you,"
returned Colin.
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was your voice," came the reply.
"Look here, doctor, I've got back a bit earlier than
I expected, and I want to see you as soon as possible.
Can you come up to the Yard straight away?"
</p>

<p>
"I can be there in half an hour," said Colin.
</p>

<p>
"That will do all right.  Don't be later if you can
help it.  I've been let in for an unexpected appointment
at four o'clock, and there are several things I'd
like to talk to you about first."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if it comes to that," remarked Colin, "there's
something I'm pretty anxious to discuss with you."
</p>

<p>
"Anything serious?" rapped out the other.
</p>

<p>
"Only that somebody tried to murder me last night."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tried to murder you!</i>  Who was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Seems to have been a syndicate," was the answer.
"The principal parties were two gentlemen called
'Spike' Cooper and Jake Hudson, both of this parish.
The third one was the same cheery sportsman who
kicked you in the tummy."
</p>

<p>
He heard a muttered exclamation at the other end
of the telephone.
</p>

<p>
"You had better not say any more now.  Come
along up immediately.  If this is true it's of the
utmost importance."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Colin drily.  "It struck me that way
too."
</p>

<p>
He replaced the receiver, and, turning round, found
Mark and Nancy standing in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"I have been summoned to Scotland Yard at once,"
he informed them.  "Marsden seems as anxious to
see me as I am to see him."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he's got hold of some clue about the
murder?" suggested Mark.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't wonder," said Colin.  "I know he
went down into the country to look up the Professor's
old servant this morning, and he certainly spoke as
though things were beginning to move."  He turned
toward the pegs and started to unhook his hat and
coat.
</p>

<p>
"How are you going to get there?" inquired Mark.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've brought the car along with me.  It's only
round the corner at Higgins's place."
</p>

<p>
"You'll promise to be careful, won't you?" said
Nancy rather anxiously.  "I hate to let you out of my
sight until those three men have been arrested."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't worry about them," returned
Colin with a laugh.  "They must have found out by
now that they made a bloomer last night, and it's
a hundred to one that the whole lot have skedaddled."
</p>

<p>
"Major Fenton won't have run away," persisted
Nancy.  "He has no idea that you saw him talking
to Cooper, and there's nothing else to connect him
with the affair."
</p>

<p>
"No, that's true," admitted Colin.  "He must be
feeling as sick as the devil, and probably in a blue
funk as well, but the only thing he can do is to sit
tight and hope for the best."
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow, he'll be lying fairly low for the moment,"
agreed Mark.  "You bung along off, my son, and get
back as soon as possible.  You'll find Nancy and me
here, unless we've burst with curiosity."
</p>

<p>
It was exactly on the stroke of a quarter past three
when, with a sharp blast from his horn, Colin shot
past the policeman on duty and pulled up neatly in the
centre court of Scotland Yard.  Before he could
attempt to dismount two indignant constables were
alongside of him.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" demanded one.  "Don't you know
it's against the regulations to bring in a car without
permission?"
</p>

<p>
"Sorry," said Colin penitently.  "The fact is, I've
got a very urgent appointment with Inspector Marsden.
He telephoned me to be here at a quarter past
without fail."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you take my advice and be a bit more
careful the next time," observed his interrogator, "or as
likely as not you'll find yourself in trouble."  He
turned to his companion.  "Better take him up at
once.  The Inspector's in his room."
</p>

<p>
Climbing out of the car and following his guide,
Colin ascended the flight of stone stairs until they
reached the same apartment to which Marsden had
conducted him before.  Having inquired his name, the
constable rapped loudly, and in answer to a peremptory
invitation pushed open the door and stepped
briskly forward.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor Gray to see you by appointment, sir."
</p>

<p>
Marsden blotted the letter that he was writing and
got up from his desk.
</p>

<p>
"Come along in, doctor," he called out; and then,
as Colin entered, he pulled forward a chair and
motioned the constable to withdraw.
</p>

<p>
"Take that seat," he added, directly the door was
shut.  "There's no time to waste, and I want to hear
your story before we discuss anything else.  Don't
hurry, though; tell it me in your own way, just as you
did when you described the murder."
</p>

<p>
Colin laid his hat on the floor, and, thrusting his
hands in his pockets, commenced to speak.
</p>

<p>
In very much the same words that he had used to
Mark he repeated the whole history of Fenton's
relations with Nancy and himself, taking the utmost care
to omit nothing which might have any conceivable
bearing on the case.  Then, still in the same methodical
and detached fashion, he went on to relate the
remainder of his story, while all the time the Inspector
sat by in grim silence, his hard blue eyes fixed intently
on his companion's face.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how it strikes you," observed Colin,
when he had quite finished, "but Nancy and I have
been chewing it over pretty thoroughly, and we both
think that it would take a damn sight more than a
mere fit of jealousy to make Fenton risk his neck.
We feel certain that there must be something much
bigger at the back of it all, but beyond that we're
absolutely gravelled."
</p>

<p>
Without replying, Marsden leaned forward and
pulled open a drawer in his desk.  He turned over
some of its contents, and then, taking out an
unmounted photograph, handed it to Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Do you recognize that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Colin sat up, with a sudden start of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Recognize it!" he exclaimed.  "Of course I do.
It's 'Spike' Cooper."
</p>

<p>
"You're sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Positive.  You don't suppose I'd forget his
infernal face?"  He inspected the picture carefully for
several seconds, and then passed it back.  "Where
did you get hold of this?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It was sent to me three days ago by the Canadian
police.  Perhaps you would like to hear the letter
that came with it."
</p>

<p>
He dived into the drawer again, and produced an
official-looking sheet of blue paper.
</p>

<p>
"With reference to your inquiry of the 3d ult.,"
he read, "we now enclose the photograph, record,
and finger prints of Luke Hammond, which were not
included in our reply of the 15th.  We have since
ascertained that Hammond has left Canada and is
probably in London."
</p>

<p>
"And what <i>is</i> his record?" demanded Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Quite a useful one in its way," was the dry
answer.  "Two terms of imprisonment for housebreaking
and one of ten years for robbery with
violence.  Our friends at Montreal seem to regard
him as one of the show cases in their collection."
</p>

<p>
"Fenton has been in Canada," remarked Colin; "at
least, so it said in that report you gave me.  They
probably met each other over there."
</p>

<p>
"Not a doubt of it," returned the detective, "and,
what's more, I shouldn't be much surprised if he came
to England on Fenton's invitation."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.  "We seem to be getting on,"
remarked Colin, "but, all the same, I'm hanged if I
can make head or tail of it even now.  Why on earth
should a cashiered major and a Canadian crook be
thirsting for my blood?"
</p>

<p>
Marsden replaced the paper and shut the drawer.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor Gray," he said, "have you any objection to
leaving this entirely in my hands for the next twenty-four
hours?  I shall give instructions at once for the
arrest of Cooper and Hudson, and you can take it
from me that there are not likely to be any more
attempts on your life.  If it would make you more
comfortable, I will arrange for you to be shadowed
from the moment you leave this office."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, no!" exclaimed Colin.  "It would
make me feel as if I were a co-respondent in a divorce
case.  I should like to have had five minutes alone
with the blighter who hit me on the head, but if it can't
be managed I'm quite content to leave him to you."  He
took his hands from his pockets and sat up in his
chair.  "And now," he added, "what have you got
to tell me?  I'm dying to hear if you found out
anything from this chap Kennedy."
</p>

<p>
Marsden glanced at his watch.  "I have found out
a good deal," he said, "and it was because I was
anxious to talk it over with you that I asked you to
come round.  As things have turned out, however,
it seemed to me more important that I should hear
your story first.  I am afraid now that we must put
off our discussion until to-morrow.  I have an
appointment with the Commissioner in a few minutes,
and it will probably be a couple of hours before I am
free."  He paused.  "I don't mind telling you one
thing, doctor, and that is that there are going to be
some developments in this case that will probably give
you the biggest surprise of your life."
</p>

<p>
Colin received the news with apparent calmness.
"Really!" he observed.  "Well, I ought to be able
to stand them.  I've had plenty of practice one way
and another."
</p>

<p>
Marsden turned to a memorandum tablet that was lying
on his desk, and studied it for a moment in silence.
</p>

<p>
"I want you all three to be here at two o'clock
to-morrow punctually," he said, "you and this man
Bates and Miss Seymour."  He picked up a pencil.
"By the way, has Miss Seymour any other Christian
name besides Nancy?"
</p>

<p>
Colin shook his head.  "Not that I know of."
</p>

<p>
"And her exact age?"
</p>

<p>
"She will be nineteen on the third of February."  Marsden
jotted down his reply, and then sat frowning
thoughtfully at the pad.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose there's no more information you can
give me in connection with her&mdash;no little fact or detail
that you've forgotten to mention?"
</p>

<p>
Colin reflected.  "By Jove, yes!" he exclaimed
suddenly.  "I've never told you that we're going to be
married."
</p>

<p>
Allowing for the Inspector's naturally reserved
manner, the effect of these few words was extraordinary.
He pushed back his chair, stared for a moment
half incredulously, and then, slapping his knee,
broke into a loud and prolonged chuckle of laughter.
</p>

<p>
Before either of them could speak again there was
a tap outside, and an apologetic constable presented
himself in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir," he said, "but the Commissioner
is ready to see you."
</p>

<p>
With an abrupt change of manner Marsden rose to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Jackson," he said.  "I will be down
immediately."
</p>

<p>
Then, as the door closed, he took a step forward,
and with another hearty chuckle gripped hold of
Colin's hand.
</p>

<p>
"I congratulate you with all my heart, doctor," he
said. "Unless I'm a damned fool, you're the luckiest
man in England."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TEN
</h3>

<p>
"More coffee?" suggested Mark.
</p>

<p>
Colin pushed over his cup, and, having taken
possession of the last slice of toast, proceeded to
scrape out the remainder of the marmalade.
</p>

<p>
"I seem to be eating rather a lot," he observed
apologetically.  "I suppose it's the result of being
in love."
</p>

<p>
Mark laughed and glanced at the clock.  "It seems
to have affected Nancy in the same way.  Anyhow,
this is the first time I've ever known her late."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't be brutal to her," said Colin; "it's
all my fault.  I took her out to supper after the theatre
last night, and we didn't get back to her place until
nearly one o'clock.  I expect she was a bit sleepy this
morning."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll try and overlook it for once," replied
Mark generously.  He produced his pipe, and, after
stuffing the bowl with tobacco, tossed the pouch across
the table.  "What are your plans for this morning?"
he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I've got to find Joe," was the answer.  "Marsden
wants him at the Yard at two o'clock, so I must go
along to the Palace and see if I can get hold of his
address."
</p>

<p>
"You had better tell him to come here at half-past
twelve," said Mark.  "He can have some lunch with
us, and then you can all go up together in the car."
</p>

<p>
"That's a bright idea," agreed Colin.  "I'm afraid
that, in one way and another, I'm becoming a bit of
a nuisance, though."
</p>

<p>
"Not the slightest," returned Mark.  "I'm enjoying
myself immensely.  It's so dull down here as a
rule that any little thing like a love affair or an
attempted murder is a perfect godsend."
</p>

<p>
He sauntered off to the surgery, and a few minutes
later Colin, having scribbled a brief note to Nancy
and left it on the hall table, was striding along the
street in the direction of the Whitechapel Road.
</p>

<p>
No one could describe the thoroughfares through
which he had to pass as picturesque or engaging, but
in the crisp morning air, and with a yellow sun
shining down from overhead, the two-mile walk was not
without a certain attraction.
</p>

<p>
He was in the kind of mood, indeed, in which even
the Dead Sea or the Sahara Desert would probably
have appeared to possess some favourable features.
Ever since he had discovered his real feelings toward
Nancy the whole world seemed to have become an
extraordinarily interesting and exciting place.  At the
present moment, both these sensations were intensified
by the prospect of his approaching interview with
Marsden.  From the way in which the detective had
spoken there could be little doubt that he had made
some important discoveries, and the mere thought that
in a few hours he might be helping to track down the
Professor's murderer was sufficient in itself to set
every nerve in Colin's body tingling with a fierce
elation.
</p>

<p>
Half-an-hour's walk brought him to the Palace, a
gaudy structure wedged in between two public houses.
The only person about who appeared to have any
connection with the establishment was an elderly man with
a bucket of paste, who was leisurely engaged in affixing
a poster to one of the two boards which decorated
each side of the entrance.
</p>

<p>
Colin pulled up alongside of him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you happen to know where Joe Bates lives?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
The other paused in his work, and eyed him with
some suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"Yus," he replied, "an' wot abaht it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much," returned Colin.  "I happen to
be a pal of his, and I want to see him.  My name's
Doctor Gray."
</p>

<p>
The elderly man's expression changed instantly.
"Ow," he remarked, "that's orl right.  I've 'eard 'im
speak o' you.  You're the bloke as mended 'im up
when 'e was in 'orspital?  Thinks the world o' you,
Joe does, an' no error."
</p>

<p>
"Well, in that case," said Colin, "perhaps you will
trust me with his address?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, o' course," was the answer.  "No offence,
mister, but I didn't know who you was when you come
askin' fust.  Might 'a' been one o' these 'ere blarsted
rate collectors."  He laid down his brush, and,
stepping out on the pavement, pointed across toward a
narrow turning on the opposite side of the road.
"You foller that," he said, "an' when you come to the
last 'ouse on the right jest give a couple o' taps on the
front winder."
</p>

<p>
Colin thanked him, and, crossing the street, made
his way down the alley in question, until he arrived
at the farther end.  Joe's residence proved to be a
single-fronted dwelling of grimy brick, the ground
floor window of which opened on to the street.  A
square of not over-clean muslin had been nailed up
inside, in order to secure the owner's privacy, but at
Colin's second knock this obstruction was cautiously
lifted, and Joe's face peered out inquiringly through
the dirty glass.
</p>

<p>
On recognizing the visitor, it disappeared again at
once, and the next moment a burly figure in trousers
and shirt sleeves swung open the front door.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't believe me own eyes, doctor," announced
the prize-fighter with a grin of welcome.  "'Ow the
blazes did you manage to find your way 'ere?"
</p>

<p>
"I got your address from an elderly gentleman who
was shoving up bills outside the Palace," said Colin.
"He wouldn't part with it until I told him who I was."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that'd be old Tom," returned Joe, nodding
his head.  "'E ain't the sort to let 'is mouth flap, not
unless 'e's sure of 'is comp'ny."  He stepped back
into the passage, holding open the door.  "Come
along in, doctor.  I ain't got much of a place, but,
such as it is, you're more than welcome."
</p>

<p>
Colin followed his host into a tiny apartment on
the left, on the walls of which were nailed up a number
of coloured prints, representing various well-known
boxers in highly aggressive attitudes.  In the centre
of the room stood a deal table, containing a couple of
bottles of Bass and the smaller half of a brown loaf.
A bed, a dilapidated chair, and an old packing-case,
full of odds and ends, completed the remainder of the
furniture.
</p>

<p>
"I was jest goin' to 'ave me breakfast," explained
Joe, indicating the refreshments.  "If you'd fancy a
drop, guv'nor, I can borrow a glass from the bloke
upstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Not for me, thanks," said Colin.  "I always go
to sleep if I drink beer in the morning, and besides, I
have only looked in to tell you that you'll be wanted
this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Joe's eyes glistened.  "Goin' to shove it across 'em?"
he inquired eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I wish we were," was Colin's reply, "but I'm
afraid it's nothing as exciting as that.  The fact is,
I had a talk with Inspector Marsden yesterday, and
he wants you and me and Miss Seymour to meet him
at Scotland Yard at two o'clock."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Joe seemed somewhat taken aback.
</p>

<p>
"If them's the orders," he said at last, "there ain't
no more to be said abaht it.  I never thought to see
meself walkin' in there, though, not of me own accord."
</p>

<p>
"They'll be civil enough," said Colin.  "They only
want to hear your story about getting me out of the
cellar."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay you're right," admitted Joe doubtfully.
"I ain't got nothin' special against the perlice; all I
says is that the less you 'as to do with 'em the better."
He paused.  "Wot's the programme, guv'nor?  Do
I jest step up to the front door an' 'and in me
card?"
</p>

<p>
"Doctor Ashton suggested that you should come
round to the surgery.  Then you can have some grub
and drive up with us."
</p>

<p>
Joe shook his head.  "Thankin' yer kindly, but if
it's all the same I reckon I'll meet yer there.  I gotter
couple o' torfs comin' to the Palace for a lesson this
mornin', an' it means a quid to me if I let 'em knock
me abaht a bit."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Colin, "as long as I can
depend on you to keep the appointment."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there, doctor," replied Joe.  "I'll be there,
honest to Gawd.  You bring the young laidy along in
the car, and yer'll find me sittin' on the Embankment
waitin' for yer."
</p>

<p>
Satisfied with this assurance, Colin took his
departure, and, retracing his steps to the end of the
street, made his way back to Shadwell by the same
route that he had come.
</p>

<p>
As he opened the door of the house he saw to his
surprise that the note which he had left for Nancy
was still lying on the hall table.  Before he had time
to realize anything further Mark suddenly appeared
from the surgery.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" exclaimed Colin.  "I made sure you'd
be out on your round."
</p>

<p>
"So I ought to be," replied Mark, "but, as a matter
of fact, I was waiting for you."
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm rather worried about Nancy.  She's never
turned up, and there's been no message from her."
</p>

<p>
Colin's whole figure stiffened abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"No message?" he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  I can't understand it at all.  If she's
ill, surely she'd have let us know."
</p>

<p>
Without a word Colin swung round sharply, and,
striding toward the pegs, unhooked his coat.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" demanded Mark.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get out the car and drive up there at once," he
said.  "Can you stop in for another twenty minutes?
I'll telephone you directly I find out what's the
matter."
</p>

<p>
Mark nodded.  "Keep steady, old son.  I expect
it will be all right.  There's probably some quite
simple explanation."
</p>

<p>
Colin moistened his lips.  "We were mad ever to
let her leave the house," he said hoarsely.  "If any
harm's come to her I'll kill Fenton with my own
hands."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the clock on the stairs chimed out
eleven-thirty, and, turning hastily to the door, he
hurried out again into the street.
</p>

<p>
If there is any truth in the theory that each of us
possesses a guardian angel, the fact that a quarter of
an hour later Colin drew up safely at the corner of
Jubilee Place must be regarded as an amazing tribute
to the efficiency of his own particular escort.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the car in the gutter, he jumped out on to
the pavement, and the next moment he was mounting
the narrow staircase which led up to the first landing.
</p>

<p>
There were two studios on this floor, the one which
Nancy rented being distinguished by a small brass
knocker.  Catching hold of the knob, Colin rapped
loudly, and then, bending down, lifted up the flap
of the letter box.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy," he called out, "are you there?  It is
I&mdash;Colin."  There was no answer.
</p>

<p>
He straightened himself slowly, and as he did so
the door of the second studio was pulled back and a
girl appeared in the opening.  She was a fair-haired,
cheerful-looking girl, wearing a brown overall and
smoking a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse my butting in," she said, "but do you
want to speak to Miss Seymour?"
</p>

<p>
Colin took off his hat.  "I do," he said, "rather
particularly."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm afraid it's no good waiting," was the
answer.  "She went out just after eight o'clock this
morning, and I know she won't be back till late,
because she asked me to take in a parcel for her."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you don't happen to know where she
was going to?" asked Colin.  "Please forgive my
curiosity, but I am a friend of Doctor Ashton's, for
whom Miss Seymour works, and as she hasn't turned
up and has sent no message, we are both feeling rather
anxious about her."
</p>

<p>
"She has gone to see her lawyer," replied the girl.
"He sent a car around to fetch her, that's why she
went off in such a hurry."
</p>

<p>
Colin stared at her in astonishment.  "Her lawyer?"
he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"That's what she told me.  I think from the way
she spoke he wanted to see her suddenly about some
important business.  Anyhow, I know the chauffeur
brought a letter with him, because she had it in her
hand."
</p>

<p>
"Did you notice the man?" demanded Colin,
"Would you be able to describe him again?"
</p>

<p>
The girl raised her eyebrows.  "I don't suppose
so," she said coolly.  "He was on the landing, but it
doesn't happen to be a habit of mine to stare at
chauffeurs."
</p>

<p>
With a big effort Colin pulled himself together.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," he said.  "Perhaps I ought
to explain.  Miss Seymour and I are engaged to be
married, so you will understand why I'm feeling
worried about this sudden disappearance of hers."
</p>

<p>
The girl looked up at him sympathetically.  "Why,
of course," she replied, "but surely there's no reason
to be alarmed?  I expect she intended to ring up
when she reached the lawyer's office, and then something
came along and put it out of her head.  She has
probably done so by now."
</p>

<p>
"It won't take me long to find out, anyhow," said
Colin.  He paused.  "Are you likely to be at home
the rest of the day?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
His companion nodded.  "Yes," she said.  "I live
here.  I'm an artist."
</p>

<p>
"Then, just in case Miss Seymour does come home,
would you mind asking her to let Doctor Ashton know
immediately?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I will," said the girl.  "Even if I don't
hear her, she's sure to look in in order to see about the
parcel."  She hesitated.  "I&mdash;I should like to
congratulate you, if I may," she added.  "I don't know
Miss Seymour very well&mdash;I have only been in this
studio a few weeks&mdash;but one's merely got to speak to
her to see that she's a perfect dear."
</p>

<p>
In spite of his anxiety, Colin smiled at her gratefully.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you so much," he said.  "I'll tell Nancy
what a brick you've been."
</p>

<p>
He shook her hand and, leaving her standing in
the doorway, hurried downstairs again into the
street.
</p>

<p>
There was a chemist's shop at the corner which
boasted a public telephone, and, entering the box, he
rang up Mark.
</p>

<p>
"No news here," came the reply in answer to his
first inquiry.  "How about you?"
</p>

<p>
In a few words Colin acquainted him with the story
he had just been told, giving the bare facts exactly as
he had heard them from the girl.
</p>

<p>
"It seems a devilish queer business," was Mark's
comment, after a short pause.  "What are you going
to do about it?"
</p>

<p>
"I know the name of her lawyer at Helston," said
Colin.  "It's Penwarren.  I shall send a telegram at
once to find out whether he's in London."
</p>

<p>
"And suppose he's not?"
</p>

<p>
"In that case there's only one explanation.  She's
in the hands of that brute Fenton, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look here," broke in Mark, "shall I come up and
join you?  I can easily put off my round until this
evening."
</p>

<p>
"I would rather you stayed at the surgery for the
present," replied Colin.  "A message might come
through from Nancy any time, and I shall have to
give Penwarren your address so that he can have
somewhere to reply to.  I'll ring you up again about
half-past one, before I see Marsden.  We ought to
have an answer by then."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be here," said Mark.  "Don't you worry more
than you can help.  Even if you're right, Nancy can't
be in any real danger; the police will have her back
in a few hours."
</p>

<p>
"Please God," said Colin fervently.
</p>

<p>
He replaced the receiver, and, leaving the shop,
walked on quickly up the King's Road until he reached
the post office.  Here, after destroying two previous
attempts, he wrote out the following wire, which he
signed in Mark's name:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"I shall be very grateful if you will let me know
immediately whether Mr. Penwarren is in London
and whether he has any business to discuss with
Miss Nancy Seymour.  Miss Seymour is in my
employment.  The matter is extremely urgent."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He handed this to the girl behind the counter, and,
having paid for a reply, made his way back to where
he had left the car.
</p>

<p>
He had done everything he could think of for the
present, but the knowledge of this fact deepened
rather than lessened his anxiety.  The whole affair
was so extraordinary that he had an instinctive feeling
that there must be something evil at the back of it.
Was it likely or even possible that the summons which
Nancy had received could really have come from
Mr. Penwarren?  Even if he were in town, for what
conceivable reason could he have sent to fetch her at
eight o'clock in the morning?  And yet, knowing
Nancy's character, it seemed equally incredible that
she should have left the studio under such circumstances,
without being absolutely convinced that the
message was a genuine one.
</p>

<p>
If she had fallen into a trap, there could be no
doubt whose hand had set it.  The affair in Flood
Lane proved that, whatever motive lurked behind
Fenton's proceedings, he had now reached a point
where nothing would be allowed to stand in his way.
He was certainly quite capable of having abducted
Nancy, though, in view of the hue and cry which he
must have known would immediately follow, it was
difficult to imagine how he could have hoped to avoid
discovery.  From all appearances it seemed to be either
the work of a madman, or else the final stroke in some
deliberate scheme, the apparent weaknesses of which
had been carefully guarded against.
</p>

<p>
It was the dread of this latter alternative which
was clutching at Colin's heart as he once more reached
the corner of Jubilee Place.  Should it prove to be
the true explanation, every minute was obviously of
the greatest value, and the prospect of remaining idle
for the next two hours filled him with an almost
intolerable revolt.
</p>

<p>
Unless he could get hold of Marsden personally,
however, it seemed useless to communicate with the
police until he had received a reply from Helston.
They were not likely to take action on mere suspicion,
especially when the Inspector himself had promised
to be on the spot at two o'clock.  As to whether there
was any chance of his arriving earlier Colin had no
idea, but, since the only other course was to do nothing,
he decided that he might just as well drive up to
Whitehall straight away.
</p>

<p>
With this resolve he started the car, and, turning
down through Burton Court on to the Embankment,
swung round to the left in the direction of
Westminster Bridge.  A sharp run of about seven minutes
brought him to the Yard gates, where, as usual, a
couple of stalwart-looking constables were standing on
duty.  Colin recognized one of them as his acquaintance
of the previous day, and with a friendly nod he
pulled up alongside.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, sir," observed the man approvingly.
"No objection to your coming in now we know
who you are."
</p>

<p>
Colin leaned forward from the driving seat.
</p>

<p>
"Do you happen to know whether Mr. Marsden is
about anywhere?" he asked.  "He made an appointment
with me for two o'clock, but something rather
important has cropped up, and if possible I should like
to see him at once."
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't been in this way," was the policeman's
answer, "but he might have come along by one of the
other entrances.  You can go inside and inquire, if
you like.  The officer on duty will be able to find out
for you."
</p>

<p>
Colin thanked him, and, steering his car through
the gates, came to a halt in front of the broad flight
of steps which led up to the main door.
</p>

<p>
Another constable advanced inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so," he replied, in answer to Colin's
question; "but if you like to wait a moment I can let
you know for certain."
</p>

<p>
He disappeared within the building, returning after
a short absence with a significant shake of his head.
</p>

<p>
"No one's heard anything of him yet, sir.  They
expect him at two o'clock, though."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Colin.  "I've got an appointment
with him."  He paused.  "Can I leave the car here
until then?"
</p>

<p>
The constable scratched his head.  "Well, this
ain't exactly a garage," he replied doubtfully.  "Still,
if you back her up quite into that corner&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He turned aside as he spoke, and, pocketing the
five shillings which Colin slipped into his hand,
sauntered back to his former position.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
With the best part of an hour and a half before him
Colin came out into Whitehall and paused irresolutely
on the edge of the pavement.  Of all the tasks with
which an impatient man can be confronted, that of
killing time is perhaps the most trying.  He was not
in the least hungry, and, in any case, there was something
ghastly in the thought of sitting all that while
in a half-empty restaurant, brooding miserably over
what might have happened to Nancy.  If he wished to
keep his nerves steady, it seemed to him that some
form of exercise was imperatively needed, and,
without hesitating further he made his way across
Parliament Green, and struck off westward along the
Embankment.
</p>

<p>
The soundness of his instinct was proved by the
fact that when he arrived back at Westminster Bridge,
after a vigorous tramp of about six miles, he felt that,
whatever the next few hours might bring, his mind
and judgment were once more under proper control.
The hands of Big Ben were already at five and twenty
minutes to two, and, knowing that there was a public
telephone in the station, he crossed the road and
entered the box.  After a brief delay he succeeded in
getting Mark's number.
</p>

<p>
"That you, Colin?" came the latter's voice.  "Yes,
I've just got an answer to the wire.  It arrived a few
minutes ago.  If you hold on I'll read it out to you."
There was a pause.  "'Mr. Penwarren is ill in bed
at Helston.  As far as we are aware he has had no
communication with Miss Seymour for the last eighteen
months.  Should be glad of an explanation.'"
</p>

<p>
"It's only what I expected," said Colin quietly.
"There must be something wrong, or Nancy would
have let us know long before this."
</p>

<p>
"Have you told the police?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet.  I went up to the Yard, but Marsden
hadn't arrived, so I thought I'd better wait until we
got the reply from Helston."
</p>

<p>
"Where are you telephoning from?"
</p>

<p>
"Westminster Bridge Station.  I've arranged to
meet Joe close by here, and, unless anything's happened,
he ought to be along in a few minutes.  By that
time Marsden will probably have turned up."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm ready when you want me," observed
Mark.  "In case there's going to be trouble, you can
count me in to the limit."
</p>

<p>
"I know that," returned Colin gratefully.  "If
there's any possible way in which you can be of help
I'll ring you up and let you know."
</p>

<p>
He put down the receiver, and, leaving the station,
walked slowly round the corner on to the Embankment.
A few yards past the entrance to the Yard,
on the opposite side of the road, were a couple of
empty seats facing the river.  He crossed over
toward the first one, and, having lighted himself a
cigarette, sat down patiently to wait for Joe.
</p>

<p>
Just as the opening strokes of a quarter to two
were chiming out from the clock tower, the latter
made his appearance.  In a quiet and unobtrusive
fashion he slipped suddenly into view round the
pedestal of Boadicea's statue, and at the same moment
a grin of recognition broke over his face as his eyes
lit upon Colin.  He quickened his steps, and came
rapidly up to the seat.
</p>

<p>
"Thought you might be early, doctor," he began,
"so I come along a bit ahead o' me time on purpose."  He
looked round inquiringly.  "But where's the young
laidy?"
</p>

<p>
Colin, who had thrown away his cigarette, rose to
his feet.  "I've got some bad news for you, Joe," he
said.  "Miss Seymour has disappeared."
</p>

<p>
Joe's mouth opened, and he gazed blankly at his
companion.
</p>

<p>
"Disappeared!" he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"She was taken away in a car at eight o'clock this
morning.  Some one tricked her into leaving the studio
by means of a false message."
</p>

<p>
With a muttered oath Joe clutched him by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Wot, the saime swine that tried to do you in?"
</p>

<p>
Colin nodded.  "Unless I'm wrong, it's the man I
spoke to you about&mdash;Major Fenton; the one who was
talking to 'Spike' Cooper outside the station."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if yer knows that," exclaimed Joe, "wot the
'ell are we messin' abaht 'ere for?  Why don't we go
an' wring 'is blarsted neck?"
</p>

<p>
"Because we've got to find him first," returned Colin
curtly.  "That's why I've been waiting to keep this
appointment with the Inspector.  The police are after
him too, so they may be able to help us."
</p>

<p>
Joe wiped his forehead with the back of his hand.
</p>

<p>
"For Gawd's sake let's get over and see 'em,
guv'nor.  I wouldn't 'ave no 'arm come to that
young laidy, not for all the money in the Bank of
England."
</p>

<p>
Colin gave a queer laugh.  "I think I can understand
the feeling," he said.
</p>

<p>
They crossed the road toward the Yard, where the
same two constables were still on duty.
</p>

<p>
"You're all right now, mister," remarked one of
them.  "I saw him come in by the other way a few
minutes ago."
</p>

<p>
With a nod of thanks Colin passed through the
gates, and, followed by Joe, who kept casting
mistrustful glances to right and left, walked rapidly up
to the main entrance.
</p>

<p>
The recipient of his five-shilling tip stepped forward
to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Marsden has just come, sir," he announced.
"Told me that when you and your party arrived I
was to bring you in straight away."
</p>

<p>
"Well, this is my party," said Colin.  "At least,
all of it that's likely to turn up."
</p>

<p>
He beckoned to Joe, who had halted a couple of
paces in the rear, and, mounting the steps, the two of
them followed the constable into the building.  He
led the way up the staircase to Marsden's room, where,
in response to his knock, the Inspector himself opened
the door.  Over his shoulder Colin caught sight of
another man in plain clothes, who was standing with
his back to the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Come along in, doctor," exclaimed the detective.
"I've got some one here you ought to know&mdash;Inspector
Ainsworth, of the Investigation Department.  He
has been doing some rather useful work for you
during the last twenty-four hours."
</p>

<p>
Colin shook hands with his new acquaintance, a
stout, gray-haired individual, who eyed him with
considerable interest.
</p>

<p>
"And this is our friend Bates, eh?" continued Marsden,
turning a sharp glance on Joe.  "But where's
Miss Seymour?  I thought you were going to bring
her with you."
</p>

<p>
"You had better hear what I've got to tell you
straight away," said Colin.  "Miss Seymour never
came to Shadwell this morning.  I went up to her
flat just before midday, and I found out from the
girl next door that someone had called for her in a
car at eight o'clock with a letter from her lawyer in
Cornwall."
</p>

<p>
"What, Penwarren?" broke out Marsden.  "Impossible!
Why, he's seriously ill down at Helston."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Colin.  "I sent him a wire at once
and I've just got the answer.  The letter was a
forgery.
</p>

<p>
"And Miss Seymour?" demanded Marsden quickly.
</p>

<p>
"She went away in the car and nothing has been
heard of her since."
</p>

<p>
Marsden took a couple of paces across the room,
and then turned to his colleague.
</p>

<p>
"I blame myself for this, Ainsworth," he said.  "I
ought to have had the place watched."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," assented the other.  "All the same, I
don't think there's any harm done.  It's plain enough
what they're after, but if they want to bring it off
they'll have to take her abroad.  You can't work that
sort of gadget in England."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause, which was broken by
Marsden.  "You had better get hold of Graham
immediately.  Tell him that the girl's been kidnapped,
and that an attempt will probably be made to smuggle
her out of the country.  They're already on the
lookout for Cooper, so it will only be a matter of sending
another message."
</p>

<p>
Giving a curt nod, Ainsworth strode to the door,
and, with an abrupt change in his manner, Marsden
addressed himself to Colin.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry this has happened," he said, "especially
as it's partly my fault.  I wish to God you
could have let me know sooner."
</p>

<p>
"I came along immediately," retorted Colin, "but
you weren't here."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Marsden hesitated.  "Have you
any idea who Miss Seymour really is?" he asked
slowly.
</p>

<p>
Colin stared at him.  "What do you mean?" he
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"She is the granddaughter of Professor Carter, and
the heiress to over a quarter of a million of money."
</p>

<p>
If the Professor himself had suddenly appeared
through the doorway Colin's amazement could hardly
have been more complete.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" he stammered.  "Is this true?  Are
you certain of it?"
</p>

<p>
"I am quite certain of it&mdash;now," was the answer.
"I have suspected it was so for the last two days,
but what I have found out this morning puts the
matter beyond question."  He took hold of a chair
and thrust it toward Colin.  "Sit down for a moment,
doctor.  I know how impatient and anxious you
must be feeling, but I can assure you that I sha'n't
waste a second.  Before we go any further it's
essential that you should hear the truth."
</p>

<p>
"Get on with it, then," said Colin hoarsely.  "I
don't want a chair.  I'd rather stand."
</p>

<p>
Marsden walked across to his desk and seated himself
in front of an open cardboard file, containing a
number of papers.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember what I told you the morning
after the murder?" he asked.  "That if we could find
the Professor's old servant, Kennedy, we should
probably learn something which would alter our whole
view of the case?"
</p>

<p>
Colin nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, a couple of days ago I got a message from
the Hertford police that they had run him to earth in
a small village near Hoddesdon.  He has been paralyzed
and bedridden for some months, and as the old
woman who has been looking after him can't even
read or write, he might easily have died without ever
hearing of the murder.  As it was, we got hold of him
just in time.  I went down there yesterday, and,
although he was so ill that he could hardly speak, he
managed to give me the one bit of information that I
was so badly in need of.  He told me that twenty-three
years ago Nancy Carter, the Professor's only
daughter, then a girl of eighteen, had run away from
her home and married a young artist called Richmond
Seymour."
</p>

<p>
Colin took a step forward, but before he could
speak the detective raised his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Let me finish first, and then I'll answer any
questions you like.  It seems from Kennedy's story that
the Professor was one of those self-willed, obstinate
sort of people who simply don't know the meaning of
the word 'forgiveness.' He had forbidden this marriage,
and, since his daughter had chosen to disobey
him, he made up his mind that he would have nothing
more to do with her.  Kennedy tells me that from that
time forward he never even mentioned her name again.
</p>

<p>
"Well, to cut a long story short, as soon as I heard
this the two names 'Nancy Seymour' came back to
my mind at once.  I'd written them down in my
notebook that day in the King's Road, and somehow or
other they'd stuck in my memory ever since.  I knew
nothing about the young lady except the fact that
she'd helped to save me from having my face kicked
in, but I guessed it was likely that you two had kept
in touch with each other, and so directly I got back
to town I 'phoned you to come up."  He paused.  "I
thought you'd probably be able to give me some
information, doctor, and, by God, you did."
</p>

<p>
Colin came across to the desk, and, leaning over
the back, stared eagerly in the detective's face.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, man," he exclaimed: "for heaven's sake
tell me what you mean!"
</p>

<p>
"I mean this," returned Marsden.  "You not only
convinced me that Miss Seymour is the Professor's
granddaughter, but you opened my eyes to one of the
most remarkable and cleverly laid crimes that it's ever
been my job to tackle."
</p>

<p>
"Who did it?" demanded Colin.  "Who killed the
Professor?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not referring to the murder.  I don't believe
that had anything to do with the original scheme.  It
was an accident&mdash;a very awkward accident, and quite
unforeseen.  In all probability no one regretted it
more bitterly than the two men who were chiefly
responsible for it&mdash;Major Fenton and Mr. Medwin."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Medwin!" repeated Colin in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," was the answer.  "I'll stake my official
reputation that the whole of this interesting plan
originated in the brain of Mr. James Stanhope Medwin,
solicitor, commissioner for oaths, and I should think
about the most complete rascal that ever cheated a
client."
</p>

<p>
Colin drew in a long breath.  "I was right then.
I felt that he was up to some devil's work the first
time I saw him."  He leaned forward again, his eyes
alight with anger.  "How did you find all this out?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, one thing was quite plain; whoever broke
into the Red Lodge the first time was after some
particular object which the Professor kept in his desk.
According to his own statement to you, he had nothing
there except his private papers, and, unless my
information was wrong, the only person who was likely to
have known this was Medwin.  I always make it a
rule in business to suspect everyone, no matter who
they are, and so, in spite of our friend's plausible
manner and professional standing, I put him on the
list straight away.
</p>

<p>
"It was the merest guesswork at first, but when I
discovered that the Professor had left a large fortune
and had made no will, I began to wonder whether
this rather important fact had any connection with
the attempt to search his papers.  Supposing that
Medwin had had reasons for believing in the existence
of a legal heir, but at the same time had been unable
to get hold of any definite information on the subject.
It was quite conceivable&mdash;allowing him to be a bad
lot&mdash;that he might have arranged the burglary with
a little professional assistance, and, for all we knew,
might even have succeeded in finding out what he
wanted.
</p>

<p>
"The weak point in this theory was the fact that
up till then the man had apparently had an unblemished
record.  However, I set Ainsworth to work,
and he very soon dug up a few facts which put quite
a different complexion on the matter.  He found out
that some time ago our respectable friend, who has
always had a taste for speculation, suddenly became
bitten with the Turf.  For the past two years he has
been betting heavily with several of the leading
bookmakers, and one of them&mdash;we know these gentry
pretty well at the Yard&mdash;confided to us that his own
profit in the transaction already amounted to a good
many thousand pounds.
</p>

<p>
"Having got so far, I came more or less to a standstill.
I felt convinced in my own mind that, even if
Medwin knew nothing about the murder, he was
certainly up to some hanky-panky with regard to the
money, but it's one thing to believe a man guilty and
quite another to prove it.
</p>

<p>
"It was my interview with Kennedy, and your story
coming on top of that, which suddenly did the business.
I realized at once, then, that if Miss Seymour was
really the Professor's granddaughter, Medwin and
Fenton and this fellow Cooper were probably all in
the same game.  No doubt Cooper had been roped
in to help with the burglary, and, although I had
no actual evidence that Fenton and Medwin were
friends&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I could have told you that," interrupted Colin.  "I
saw a photograph of Fenton on his mantelpiece the
day he took me to his house."
</p>

<p>
"Did you?" returned Marsden.  "Well, it's a pity
you never thought of mentioning the fact; it might
have put me on the right track straight away.  As it
is, we've had a fairly strenuous thirty-six hours.  Our
people have been ransacking Cornwall and London to
verify the truth of Kennedy's story, and by one o'clock
to-day we pretty well completed our case."  He laid
his hand on the pile.  "I have here all the evidence of
Mrs. Seymour's marriage and death, and the birth
certificate of her daughter.  There is no doubt that
Miss Seymour was her only child, and she is therefore
the sole heiress to the Professor's money."
</p>

<p>
"I've just a couple of questions I want to ask you,"
said Colin abruptly.  "In the first place, what did
these two devils mean to do with Nancy?"
</p>

<p>
"Marry her to Fenton before she found out the
truth.  Unfortunately for them, the young lady didn't
prove such an easy catch as they expected.  I fancy
you got most of the credit for that, hence the happy
notion of putting you out of the way."
</p>

<p>
Colin nodded grimly.  "And what exactly is your
theory about the murder?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the least doubt that it was the work of
'Spike' Cooper.  In all probability the other two knew
nothing about it.  I expect that when he broke into
the house the first time&mdash;most likely in company with
Medwin&mdash;he took the opportunity of having a look at
the safe.  It struck him as being a soft job, and so,
without saying a word to the others, he made up his
mind to come back again later on and see if there was
anything worth collecting.  Through some cursed
accident the Professor happened to blunder across him,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But if you know all this," broke out Colin
passionately, "why in God's name haven't you arrested
them?"
</p>

<p>
The Inspector looked up at him with unruffled coolness.
"We have done everything that's possible," he
replied.  "I can't bring a charge against Medwin
without some actual proof, and we're not likely to find
that until we get hold of Cooper and Fenton.  I've a
warrant out for each of them, and it's only a matter
of a few hours before they'll both be in custody."
</p>

<p>
"And meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;" exclaimed Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," interrupted the Inspector quickly;
"they have managed to trap the girl.  There's no
question about that, but you can take it from me that
she's not in any great danger.  Every port in England
is being closely watched, and unless they can get
her over to the Continent, and force her into a
marriage&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I'm content to sit down here and
trust to a lot of damned country policemen?" shouted
Colin hotly.  He wheeled round as he spoke, at the
same time beckoning to Joe, who, throughout the whole
interview, had remained standing discreetly in the
background.
</p>

<p>
The Inspector jumped up from his chair.  "What
are you going to do?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Do!" repeated Colin.  "I'm going to find Medwin.
He'll know where Nancy is, and I'll get the truth out
of him if I have to cut him in pieces."
</p>

<p>
He turned toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" said Marsden sharply.  He stepped forward,
his hard blue eyes fixed upon the flushed and
angry face of his companion.
</p>

<p>
"You mean this seriously, doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"O' course 'e does," chimed in Joe; "an' the saime
'ere, mister."
</p>

<p>
"I mean to find out what they're doing with Nancy,"
repeated Colin.  "If Medwin won't speak, I'll damned
well make him."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Marsden stood motionless, glancing
thoughtfully from one to the other of them.
</p>

<p>
"I'm hanged if I haven't a good mind to let you try
it," he said, suddenly.  "It's just one of those mad
things that might come off&mdash;provided it's properly
handled."
</p>

<p>
"We'll handle it all right," said Colin.  "You can
trust me for that."
</p>

<p>
"I hope I can," retorted Marsden.  "I tell you
frankly that if it weren't for Miss Seymour I should
lock you both up straight away.  I feel, however, that
it's my carelessness that's got her into this mess, and if
you can possibly force the truth out of Medwin it may
save her a lot of unpleasantness."  He paused.  "How
do you propose to set about it?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall go down to his house," said Colin, "and
tax him with the whole story."
</p>

<p>
Marsden hesitated.  "It will mean showing our
cards with a vengeance," he said, "but as things are
I don't know that it really matters.  He'd be bound
to take alarm directly he heard of the arrest of Fenton
and Cooper, and however much you frighten him he
hasn't a dog's chance of getting away."  He took
another step forward, and contemplated Colin from
under his bushy eyebrows.  "You quite understand
the position, my young friend.  Supposing anything
goes wrong, it will be no use expecting me to help you.
From the moment you leave this office you will be
acting entirely on your own responsibility."
</p>

<p>
"Of course we shall," said Colin coolly.  "The first
thing you'll know about it is when we ring up and tell
you the result."
</p>

<p>
With a faint twitch of his lips the detective held out
his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good luck to you, doctor," he said.  "That young
lady deserves <i>a man</i>, and I'll take my oath she's got
one."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER ELEVEN
</h3>

<p>
Albert Terrace appeared even more peaceful and
respectable than usual as Colin turned in at the
farther end and came to a standstill in front of
Mr. Medwin's house.
</p>

<p>
"This is the place, Joe," he said quietly.  "Now
you're quite clear in your own mind about what we've
arranged?"
</p>

<p>
Joe nodded.  "I got it, guv'nor.  You ask whether
'e's at 'ome, an' if 'e is, in we goes.  Then it'll be my
job to shove it across the butler."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said Colin.  "I'm trusting you to
look after the two servants until I've finished with
Medwin."
</p>

<p>
"I'll look after 'em," grunted Joe.  "There won't
be no trouble in that quarter, you taike my word for
it."
</p>

<p>
They got out of the car, and, leading the way up
the path, Colin pressed the electric bell.
</p>

<p>
After a brief delay they heard the sound of steps
inside, and the next moment Medwin himself opened
the door.  For an instant he stood gazing dumbly at
his two visitors, then with a sudden expansive smile
he stepped forward and held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Why, bless my soul!" he exclaimed.  "This is a
very pleasant surprise.  What an extraordinary bit
of luck that I happened to be at home."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it!" said Colin genially.  "I was just
saying to Joe that it was a hundred to one that we
shouldn't find you."  He paused.  "Oh, by the way,
may I introduce you?  This is an old friend of mine,
Mr. Joe Bates.  I've brought him along because we
both want to ask your advice."
</p>

<p>
With a deferential gesture, Joe raised his finger
to his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"'Ow d'ye do, sir," he remarked.  "Pleased to meet
yer."
</p>

<p>
"I hope we haven't called at a very inconvenient
time," continued Colin.  "The matter is rather an
urgent one, and I felt that I should like to have your
opinion on it."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't apologize, my dear boy," returned
Mr. Medwin graciously.  "If I can be of any assistance
to you I shall be only too pleased."  He moved
back, making room for them to enter.  "I have to be
my own butler to-day, because both my man and his
wife are out for the afternoon.  I send them to a
matinée every now and then, just to keep them in a
good temper."
</p>

<p>
Colin and Joe stepped into the hall, the latter, who
was the last to enter, closing the door carefully behind
him.
</p>

<p>
"I think the study will be the best place for us,"
continued their host.  "Perhaps you'd like a whisky
and soda or a glass of port first, though?"
</p>

<p>
Colin declined politely, and, still radiating good
nature, Mr. Medwin ushered them into a small room
on the left, where a bright fire was burning in the
grate.
</p>

<p>
"I use this as a kind of annex to my office," he
added.  "A large number of my clients are Kensington
people, and so sometimes it's very convenient to
be able to see them here."
</p>

<p>
"It's very convenient for us," said Colin.  "As a
matter of fact, we were particularly anxious to find
you alone."
</p>

<p>
The other, who was in the act of pulling forward a
chair, glanced up sharply at the change in his visitor's
voice.
</p>

<p>
Colin took a step forward.
</p>

<p>
"I've got several things to say to you, Medwin, but
before I start, just get this fact plainly into your
head.  If you attempt to call out or to make the
least noise, I'll smash your face to a jelly."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of dead silence, then very
slowly Medwin stepped back to the fireplace and
moistened his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Have you gone mad?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," said Colin curtly.
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the chair, and with a face from
which every vestige of colour had suddenly departed,
the lawyer silently obeyed his instructions.  Joe
moved softly toward him across the room, a formidable
and menacing figure in the gray afternoon light.
</p>

<p>
It was Colin who was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
"What have you and Fenton done with Miss Seymour?"
</p>

<p>
Medwin, who by an amazing effort seemed to have
recovered some of his self-possession, looked up with
an expression of blank amazement.
</p>

<p>
"I have never heard of Miss Seymour," he answered.
"In fact, I haven't the remotest notion what
you're talking about."
</p>

<p>
Colin came a step nearer.  "Haven't you?" he
said.  "Then perhaps I'd better explain."
</p>

<p>
He thrust his hand under Medwin's chin, and,
jerking up his face, stared down into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Now, you damned liar," he said, "listen to me.
You know as well as I do who Miss Seymour is.  You
have known it ever since you broke into the Red Lodge
and opened the Professor's desk."
</p>

<p>
He released his hold and, gripping Medwin by the
collar, shook him backward and forward as a dog
shakes a rat.
</p>

<p>
"My God, I'd kill you where you sit if I didn't
want an answer to my question.  You've not only
tried to rob and ruin this girl, but if it wasn't
for you and Fenton the Professor would be still
alive."
</p>

<p>
He flung back the half-throttled man with such
force that the woodwork of the chair cracked and
splintered beneath his weight.
</p>

<p>
Joe, who had been looking on with silent approval
hauled the victim unceremoniously to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Nah, cocky," he said, "where's the young laidy?
Spit it aht quick."
</p>

<p>
Choking and gasping for breath, Medwin retreated
toward the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"You're making some terrible mistake.  I know
nothing about it, on my honour."
</p>

<p>
"Your <i>what</i>?" Colin laughed unpleasantly.  "I
don't know if you're really under the impression that
you can bluff this out, Medwin, but if you are, you're
making the mistake of your life."
</p>

<p>
He put his hand in his pocket, and, pulling out a
coil of whipcord, which he had stopped to purchase
on his way down, tossed it across to Joe.
</p>

<p>
"Lay him on the sofa," he said, "and tie up his
feet and hands.  If he makes the slightest sound, give
him a punch in the mouth."
</p>

<p>
Joe moved forward with alacrity, and, turning to
the fireplace, Colin picked up a small ornamental
poker which was standing against the hearth, and
thrust it deliberately into the hottest part of the fire.
Then, lighting himself a cigarette, he stood looking
on in silence, while with swift efficiency Joe proceeded
to carry out his instructions.
</p>

<p>
"That will do," he observed at last, "Now, Medwin,
you can take your choice.  You will either tell me
at once where Miss Seymour is, or else I shall burn
the truth out of you with that poker."
</p>

<p>
Trussed and helpless, Medwin gazed across at him
from the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake think what you're doing," he
whispered.  "Can't you see that the whole thing's a
ghastly blunder?  I swear to you on my oath that I
have never even heard of either of the people you have
mentioned."
</p>

<p>
"In that case," said Colin, "it's rather curious that
you keep a photograph of Fenton on your dining room
mantelpiece."
</p>

<p>
He stooped down, and, drawing out the poker which
was now a glowing red, advanced relentlessly toward
the sofa.
</p>

<p>
Two little beads of perspiration broke out on Medwin's
forehead and trickled down into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" he gasped.  "Stop!  You young devil, I
believe you mean it."
</p>

<p>
Colin laughed again.  "Shove something in his
mouth, Joe.  We don't want the whole street to hear
him squealing."
</p>

<p>
By a violent effort Medwin managed to wriggle
himself up into a sitting position.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Gray," he said quietly.  "You needn't
go any further.  I know when I'm beaten."
</p>

<p>
He sank back against the cushions, and with a queer
half-incredulous expression, stared up into Colin's face.
</p>

<p>
"I am not often mistaken in my judgment of people,"
he said, "but I seem to have blundered pretty badly
with regard to you."
</p>

<p>
"Answer my questions," said Colin.  "Where's Miss
Seymour?"
</p>

<p>
"She's at Fenton's cottage in Essex, close to South
Ockendon.  It's a small white house called 'The Firs,'
on the right hand of the road, just before you reach
the village."
</p>

<p>
Colin walked to the desk and wrote down his directions
on a blank sheet of paper.
</p>

<p>
"Why have you taken her there?"
</p>

<p>
"It was Fenton's idea," said Medwin slowly.  "He
has a boat lying in the Thames close by, and he thought
that if he could persuade her to go for a short cruise
she might change her opinion about the impossibility
of marrying him."
</p>

<p>
With his fists clenched Joe started forward, but
before he could strike Colin thrust him back.
</p>

<p>
"Leave him alone, Joe," he said harshly.  "It's
the truth we want, no matter what it is."  He turned
to Medwin, who was watching them with surprising
coolness.  "Do you know what his plans are exactly?"
</p>

<p>
"He means to take her on board as soon as it's
dark.  Where he will go then depends chiefly on the
weather.  I believe he has some idea of trying to
reach Holland."
</p>

<p>
"What, by himself, in mid-winter?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's not alone," returned Medwin.  "He has
two old acquaintances of yours with him&mdash;Cooper and
Hudson.  In the course of their varied lives they have
both served before the mast."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Colin remained silent, his eyes fixed
steadily upon the lawyer's face.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know whether you're telling me the truth,
Medwin," he said.  "If you're not, heaven help you.
I'll find you again, no matter where you try to hide,
and I'll tear your lying tongue out of your throat with
my own fingers."
</p>

<p>
Medwin nodded.  "Yes," he said, "I can quite believe
you would, but, fortunately, such an unpleasant
proceeding won't be necessary.  As I told you before,
I know when the game's up."
</p>

<p>
Colin replaced the poker in the grate, then, crossing
to the desk, on which stood a portable telephone, he
unhooked the receiver and asked for Marsden's
number.  The lawyer watched him curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" came the Inspector's voice.
</p>

<p>
"This is Gray.  I'm speaking from Albert Terrace.
I've got the information I wanted."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you know where the girl is?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She's at a cottage in Essex, close to South
Ockendon.  Fenton means to take her on board his
boat as soon as it's dark."
</p>

<p>
"Who told you this?"
</p>

<p>
"Medwin.  I had to use a certain amount of
persuasion, but I think it's true."
</p>

<p>
"What have you done to him?"
</p>

<p>
"He's all right.  He's lying on the sofa listening
to what I'm saying.  We've tied him up, and we
propose to leave him here."
</p>

<p>
"How about the servants?"
</p>

<p>
"Both out at the theatre.  They're not likely to be
back until half-past five."
</p>

<p>
"Sounds as if you'd made a pretty tidy job of it,"
was Marsden's comment.  "You'd better come back
here as quickly as possible and pick me up in the car.
If what he's told you is right, the sooner we have a
look at this cottage the better."
</p>

<p>
"We're starting now," replied Colin.  "We'll be
with you in a quarter of an hour."
</p>

<p>
He rang off, and, picking up his hat from the chair,
turned to Medwin.
</p>

<p>
"This is your last chance," he said.  "You know
what to expect if you've sent me on a false errand."
</p>

<p>
"You can make your mind quite easy," returned
the other.  "You'll find Miss Seymour at the cottage,
and I have no doubt she will be delighted to see you.
You're exactly the sort of primitive young savage that
appeals to women."
</p>

<p>
Joe stepped forward pleadingly.  "Let me give 'im
one, doctor&mdash;only just one.  That'll learn 'im to call
you names."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Colin.  "Leave him alone.  He'll have
all he deserves by the time we've finished with him."
</p>

<p>
He walked toward the door, and, with one reluctant
glance at the smiling and half-prostrate figure on the
sofa, Joe followed him out into the hall.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Two men muffled up in long coats, who were waiting
just inside the entrance, stepped forward at once
as the car came to a standstill again at the main
gate-way of the Yard.
</p>

<p>
From, under the peaked cap of the former the sharp
eyes of Inspector Marsden travelled swiftly and
approvingly over its two occupants.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you don't waste much time, doctor," he
observed.  "I will say that for you."
</p>

<p>
"I'd have been here a lot sooner if it hadn't been
for the usual cursed jam in Piccadilly," returned Colin
viciously.
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he leaned over and swung open the back
door of the car.
</p>

<p>
"Just a minute," said the Inspector quietly.  "Before
we start I'd like to hear a few more details about
this interview of yours with Medwin.  We don't want
to go chasing down into Essex unless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'll give you the facts," interrupted Colin.  "If
you don't think they're good enough to act on you
can leave it to Joe and me."
</p>

<p>
In a few blunt words he described the scene which
had taken place in the study, the two detectives standing
silently beside the car, and Joe nodding his head at
intervals as though to confirm the truth of the story.
</p>

<p>
"I can't swear that he hasn't invented the whole
thing," finished Colin, "but, all the same, I'm pretty
certain there's something in it.  Whatever else Medwin
may be, he isn't a fool.  He knows perfectly well
I meant what I said, and in my opinion he's had the
sense to chuck up the sponge in order to save his own
skin."
</p>

<p>
"The guv'nor's right, mister," broke in Joe
earnestly.  "'E's a lyin' swine, this bloke, but 'e didn't
fancy the idea of 'avin' 'is tongue torn out, you could
see that by 'is faice."
</p>

<p>
Marsden laughed grimly.  "I daresay you could!"  He
turned to Colin.  "I'm shocked and surprised
that you should have taken the law into your own
hands in this way, but, between ourselves, I believe
you've done the trick."  He jerked his head toward
the back of the car.  "Jump in, sergeant.  We can
make use of the doctor's information even if we don't
approve of his methods."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he seated himself alongside of Colin,
while the sergeant, a heavily built individual with a
chin like the toe of a boot, clambered up obediently
into the tonneau.  Directly he was on board Colin
thrust in his clutch, and the next moment they were
spinning up the broad roadway in the direction of
Waterloo Bridge.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I made it plain that this isn't going to be
any sort of a picnic," said Colin, with a side glance at
his companion.  "According to Medwin, we've got
Cooper and Hudson to tackle as well as Fenton, and
I should think it's a hundred to one that they'll all
three be armed."
</p>

<p>
"Cooper will for a certainty," replied the Inspector,
"and what's more, he won't hesitate to shoot.  However,
I took the precaution of slipping a Smith and
Webley into my pocket, and I told Bentley to do the
same.  If Mister Cooper prefers a bullet to a rope,
he can damned well take his choice."
</p>

<p>
"I only hope Medwin doesn't get away," said Colin,
with some feeling.  "He's tied up all right at present,
but his servants will be back before we're through with
this job, and directly they've set him loose he'll
probably try to do a bolt."
</p>

<p>
"He may try," returned the Inspector, "but he
won't get very far.  I've sent down two of our best
men to watch the house, and, no matter where he
goes, they'll stick to him like his shadow."
</p>

<p>
He paused for a moment as Colin swerved round a
cluster of startled pedestrians, and then added with
a dry smile: "We don't want to waste any time,
doctor, but you might just keep it in mind that I'm a
married man, with three children dependent on me."
</p>

<p>
"I won't smash you up," replied Colin.  "I may
seem to be driving fast, but I've got too much at stake
to play the fool."
</p>

<p>
He cut across the broad space at the corner of
Farringdon Street, and, leaving the river on his
right hand, plunged into one of the long warehouse-lined
streets which lead through the heart of the city.
The short day was already closing in, and the tall
buildings on either side were a blaze of electric
light.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know if you're in any doubt about the way,"
said the Inspector.  "You had better consult Bentley
if you are.  He's an Essex man himself, and knows
every inch of the country."
</p>

<p>
"I think I can find it," was Colin's answer.  He
slowed down a little and glanced back over his
shoulder.  "We go through Barking and Rainham, don't
we?"
</p>

<p>
The sergeant, who was sitting up stiffly alongside
of Joe, nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, sir.  It's practically a straight road
from there to South Ockendon."
</p>

<p>
They drove on silently through the crowded streets,
the Inspector making no further attempt to talk, and
Colin devoting his whole attention to the strenuous
work of avoiding the traffic.
</p>

<p>
After negotiating the apparently interminable length
of the Commercial Road and the East India Dock
Road, they made their way through the squalid region
of East Ham and emerged at last into the historic if
evil-smelling neighbourhood of Barking.
</p>

<p>
Then, bit by bit, the houses began to give place to
stunted hedges and low-lying fields, while a little
distance away on the right the red and green lights of
the steamers passing up and down the Thames flashed
out mysteriously in the gathering dusk.
</p>

<p>
Two miles of rapid driving brought them to the
straggling village of Rainham, and, checking his speed
a trifle as they ran through the main street, Colin
swung out on to a lone stretch of country road, where
except for one or two farm carts and an occasional
belated cyclist, they seemed to be the only travellers.
</p>

<p>
He had covered about another three miles when,
with a sudden movement, the sergeant leaned over
from the back.
</p>

<p>
"We're getting pretty near now, sir," he observed.
"If your information's right, the house we want ought
to be somewhere about here."
</p>

<p>
Colin slackened down, and as he did so the bent
figure of an old man, with a pitchfork over his
shoulder, suddenly loomed into view out of an adjoining
gateway.
</p>

<p>
"Here's someone who'll probably be able to help
us," said Marsden.  "Just pull up a moment, and
we'll ask him."
</p>

<p>
They came to a standstill alongside the stranger,
who blinked at them suspiciously from under his
shaggy eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
Marsden leaned over and addressed him with a
friendly nod.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, uncle," he said.  "I wonder if you
can tell us whether there's a house called 'The Firs'
anywhere around this neighbourhood."
</p>

<p>
With considerable deliberation the veteran
unshipped his pitchfork.
</p>

<p>
"Whoy, yees, mister," he replied.  "There be a
'ouse o' that name sure enough.  There aren't no one
there though, not as I knows on."
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter," said the Inspector.  "We
only want to have a look at the outside of it."
</p>

<p>
"You don't 'ave to go far for that," was the
encouraging reply.  "You'll find it on the right-'and
side of the road soon as you've passed the nex'
turnin'."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you don't happen to know who owns the
place?" inquired Marsden.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I 'ave 'eard that it's a rich gen'leman in
London.  Party o' the name o' Fenton.  'E don't use
it much though, an' that's a fact; only comes down 'ere
for an odd day or two now an' then."
</p>

<p>
"Just when he wants a breath of fresh air, eh?"
suggested Marsden genially.  "Well, I'm much
obliged to you, uncle.  Perhaps you'll get yourself a
drink when the pubs open."
</p>

<p>
He produced a shilling, which the old man readily
accepted, and, with a slight pressure of his foot on the
clutch, Colin again set the car in motion.
</p>

<p>
"Don't hurry," whispered Marsden.  "Drive us
slowly past the place and then stop.  If any one's
inside there's pretty sure to be a light in the windows."
</p>

<p>
Following his instructions, Colin proceeded noiselessly
along the road, which curved away to the left
about a hundred yards from where they had halted.
As he rounded the bend a dark cluster of trees sprang
into view a short distance ahead of him, and the next
moment he was able to make out the roof and chimneys
of a small house, which appeared to stand a little way
back from the road.
</p>

<p>
"That's our mark," observed Marsden, with a
grunt of satisfaction.  He turned round in his seat
and addressed the sergeant.  "You hop out here,
Bentley, and have a look at it from this side.  We'll
come back and meet you at the front gate."
</p>

<p>
With surprising quickness for so heavy a man, the
sergeant stepped nimbly over on to the running board,
and, just as they reached the shelter of the trees,
dropped down into the roadway.
</p>

<p>
Driving on slowly, Colin passed the head of a
narrow lane which turned off to the right.  Beyond
it a high wooden paling fronted the main road, broken
in the centre by a couple of dilapidated iron gates,
one of which was standing partly open.  Farther
back, behind a straggling shrubbery of laurels, the
yellow gleam of a lighted window shone out into the
garden.
</p>

<p>
"Someone's at home, evidently," muttered the
Inspector.  "Take us on as far as the end of the paling
and pull up there.  I'd like to know exactly how the
land lies before we start work."
</p>

<p>
Contenting himself with a nod, Colin continued his
way along the fence until he suddenly arrived at a
closed gate leading into a ploughed field, from which
an untrimmed hedge ran up at right angles, forming
the boundary of the adjoining property.  There was
a piece of level grass at the side of the road, and,
guiding the car on to this, he stopped the engine, and
then, bending forward, switched off the headlights.
</p>

<p>
"You and Bates stay here for a moment," whispered
Marsden.  "Keep still and don't talk to each
other.  I'm just going along to have a squint through
the hedge."
</p>

<p>
Getting out of the car, he climbed carefully over
the gate, and moved up the field with the stealthiness
of a poacher, until his burly figure was gradually lost
to sight amid the shadows of the bushes.
</p>

<p>
He reappeared again after an absence of several
minutes, and both Colin and Joe leaned eagerly
forward from their seats as he clambered back and
dropped lightly down beside them.
</p>

<p>
"Everything's in darkness this side of the house,"
he announced, "and, as far as I can see, there's no way
of getting out of the garden.  We'd better make
tracks for the front gate and hear what Bentley's got
to report."
</p>

<p>
Leaving the car as it was, the three of them stole
silently back under the shelter of the fence, and came
to a halt beneath the branches of a draggled-looking
holly tree which overhung the drive.
</p>

<p>
After a brief wait they were joined by the sergeant,
who emerged furtively from the side turning and
advanced on tiptoe to where they were standing.
</p>

<p>
"I've found another entrance down the lane," he
informed them.  "It leads to a yard at the back,
where there's a big shed that looks like a garage."
</p>

<p>
"A garage, eh?" rejoined Marsden.  "Well, I guess
somebody will have to keep an eye on that side of the
house while the rest of us find some way of getting
in at the front."  He paused for a moment, and then
added quietly: "We'll take a look at the job first, and
make up our minds exactly how we're going to tackle
it.  Unless we can drop in on 'em unexpectedly it's
likely to be a pretty awkward business."
</p>

<p>
Followed by the others, he started cautiously
forward up the drive, and, skirting the edge of the
shrubbery, came out on to a neglected strip of grass,
which at some remote period had evidently been a
tennis lawn.
</p>

<p>
Facing them was the house, an old-fashioned two-storey
residence, with a tumble-down verandah half covered
in ivy.  From the French windows in the centre
a broad patch of light streamed out hospitably through
the drawn blinds.
</p>

<p>
Marsden's gaze travelled thoughtfully from one end
of the building to the other.
</p>

<p>
"There's only one way to do it," he said, in a low
voice.  "We shall have to smash in the window and
trust to luck."  He turned to the sergeant.  "We may
nab the lot of them if we're quick enough, but we can't
count on that, not when we've an old hand like Cooper
to deal with.  You'd better slip round to the yard
again, Bentley, and keep a watch on the back door."
</p>

<p>
His assistant nodded.  "Very good, sir.  It won't
take me more than a couple of minutes.  I'll give you
a whistle as soon as I'm ready."
</p>

<p>
He disappeared promptly and silently, and, stepping
back to where Colin and Joe were hiding in the
shadow, the Inspector stooped down beside them.
</p>

<p>
"I think the simplest plan will be for one of us to
tackle the window," he said.  "I'll do that, and you
two get ready to rush in the moment it's open."
</p>

<p>
"Supposing we can't force it?" whispered Colin.
"Some of these windows have a bar across on the
inside."
</p>

<p>
"In that case we must break the glass and get in as
best we can.  If Cooper looks like making trouble,
keep out of the way and leave him to me."
</p>

<p>
He produced a heavy Service revolver, and, having
clicked open the breech, proceeded to examine it with
some care.
</p>

<p>
With his hands clenched and his heart beating
fiercely, Colin started out across the lawn, waiting for
the signal.  The feeling that ever since the morning
Nancy had been a prisoner in one of those rooms, and
at the mercy of such a scoundrel as Fenton, filled him
with an apprehension that was almost unbearable.
Even if they were in time to save her from the worst
fate of all, heaven knew what hardships and misery
she must have been through during the last eight
hours.  His nerves tingled with a savage longing to
be face to face with the man who was responsible for
her sufferings, and, crouching there in the darkness, he
swore a bitter oath to himself that, whatever else
happened, Fenton should not escape.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, through the silence of the garden, a low
whistle sounded clearly from the back of the house.
Colin was on his feet instantly, but before he could
take a step forward both he and Joe were checked by
a quick movement from their companion.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go first, doctor," whispered the Inspector.
"You two keep close behind, and follow me in directly
I smash the lock."
</p>

<p>
Stooping low, and holding the revolver in his left
hand, he set off at a rapid pace across the lawn.  It
was only about twenty yards from the bushes to the
house, and in less than half a dozen seconds all three
of them were in front of the verandah.
</p>

<p>
Without pausing in his stride, Marsden made
straight for the French window.  It consisted of two
fragile-looking doors with a large pane of glass in
each, and, using his shoulder as a battering ram, the
detective hurled the full weight of his fourteen stone
against the strip of woodwork in the centre.
</p>

<p>
The other two, who were immediately behind him,
heard a splintering crash and a tinkle of broken glass.
Then in the blaze of light that streamed out through
the gap they saw Marsden stumble forward on to his
hands and knees, and, like a scene on the stage, the
whole interior of the room suddenly leaped into view.
</p>

<p>
No theatre, indeed, could have provided a more
dramatic spectacle than the one which met Colin's
eyes as he dashed for the opening.  A couple of men,
whom he recognized instantly as Cooper and Hudson,
had sprung to their feet beside an overturned card
table, and were standing as though rooted to the spot
with amazement and terror.
</p>

<p>
It was only for the fraction of a second, however,
that the tableau remained unbroken.  As Colin darted
in past the Inspector, Cooper, who was the farther
away of the two, seemed instinctively to recover his
wits.  With a movement as quick as a panther's he
dived back behind his companion, and, taking a flying
jump over the fallen table, raced headlong for the
door.
</p>

<p>
His flight seemed to act on the deserted Hudson
like the breaking of a spell.  A foul oath burst from
his lips, and, grabbing one of the overturned chairs by
its nearest leg, he hurled it with all his force straight
in the face of Colin.
</p>

<p>
The latter, who saw it coming, jerked up his arm
just in time.  It struck against his elbow and crashed
down on to the floor, tripping up Joe as he attempted
to dodge past in pursuit of the fugitive.
</p>

<p>
Staggered himself by the blow, Colin recovered almost
instantly.  One stride brought him within reach
of his assailant, and, ducking under a clumsy swing, he
smashed home a terrific right flush on the point of the
jaw.  It was a punch that would have floored
ninety-nine men out of a hundred, and Mr. Jake Hudson
was one of the unfortunate majority.  He went down
as though struck by a coal hammer, the back of his
head landing with a loud thud against the edge of the
table.
</p>

<p>
Brief though the delay had been, it had enabled
"Spike" Cooper to achieve his object.  He was through
the door and had slammed and locked it behind him
before the Inspector and Joe were able to gain their
feet.  It was Colin, indeed, who was the first to reach
it, and he was already wrenching vainly at the handle
when the two others rushed up to his assistance.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," rasped the Inspector, who was
evidently not in the best of tempers.  "Let me blow
in the lock, then we shall have a better chance."
</p>

<p>
Levelling his pistol, he emptied a couple of shots
into the keyhole, the powerful bullets smashing and
splintering the woodwork in every direction.  As the
second report died away they heard a scurry of
footsteps outside, followed almost immediately by the
unmistakable bang of another door.
</p>

<p>
Pocketing his pistol, the Inspector gripped hold of
the knob with both hands, and, as he jerked it violently
toward him, the shattered bolt snapped and yielded.
One more pull, and they stumbled over the threshold
into a dimly lighted hall, where, framed in a doorway
opposite, stood, or rather swayed, the slender figure
of a girl.
</p>

<p>
A low cry escaped Colin's lips, and, breaking from
his companions, he sprang forward and caught her
in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy!  Nancy darling!  Thank God, we've found you!"
</p>

<p>
As he uttered the words the sound of two pistol
shots rang out from the back of the house, and with
a stifled oath the Inspector hurried toward them.
</p>

<p>
"Which is the way through into the yard?" he
demanded.
</p>

<p>
Nancy pointed across toward a door on the right.
</p>

<p>
"There!" she gasped.  "But it's locked.  I heard
them lock it and bolt it.  You can only get round by
the garden."
</p>

<p>
"Come with me, Bates," snapped the Inspector.
"You stop here, doctor, and take care of the girl."
</p>

<p>
He ran toward the sitting room, followed by Joe,
while Nancy, who had momentarily straightened herself
as she answered his question, sank weakly back
again against Colin's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Lifting her in his arms, he carried her to a small
couch which was standing against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Nancy," he whispered, "tell me.  Are you
hurt?"
</p>

<p>
With a gallant effort she smiled up reassuringly into
his face.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said.  "I am only tired out and a little
faint.  I&mdash;I've been through a good deal since this
morning, Colin."
</p>

<p>
He sat down beside her, taking her hands in his.
</p>

<p>
"They brought you a forged letter from Penwarren,
didn't they?  The girl who lives next door to you told
us something about it."
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "I suppose it was foolish of me to be
taken in, but it looked to me just like his handwriting.
It said that he had suddenly discovered the truth
about my father and mother, and that he had come
up to town especially to see me.  I went off in the
car almost without thinking."
</p>

<p>
"Where did they take you to?"
</p>

<p>
"Some house close to Kensington High Street.
There was another man there besides Major Fenton&mdash;a
horrible middle-aged, smiling man&mdash;and when
they got me inside they held me down and drugged me
with a hypodermic syringe.  I think it must have
been opium they gave me.  Anyhow, the next
thing I remember is waking up with a frightful
headache, and finding myself locked up alone in that
room."
</p>

<p>
With great difficulty Colin managed to steady his
voice. "How long ago was that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It seems ages, but I think it must have been about
the middle of the day."
</p>

<p>
"And when did Fenton come back?"
</p>

<p>
"Just as it was growing dark.  He had been down
to the river to get the yacht ready, and had left one
of the men here to look after me.  He told me
exactly what he meant to do&mdash;that he was going to
take me away on the boat and keep me there
until&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash;"  Her voice faltered.
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Colin quickly.  "I've had the whole
story from Medwin!"
</p>

<p>
"The whole story!  Oh, Colin, what does it mean?
Why should he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You shall hear everything in a minute," he
interrupted.  "Just tell me first what happened when we
broke into the house."
</p>

<p>
"It was all over so quickly," said Nancy.  "He was
in there talking to me and threatening me when he
suddenly heard a tremendous crash, and one of the
others&mdash;the man they call Spike&mdash;rushed into the room
and shouted out something about the police.  Before
I could&mdash;&mdash;"  She stopped abruptly.  "Listen!" she
exclaimed.  "They're coming back."
</p>

<p>
There was a sound of voices and steps on the
verandah outside, and, letting go Nancy's hands, Colin
jumped to his feet.
</p>

<p>
He walked across to the sitting-room door, where
the sight which met his eyes caused him to hurry
forward with a sudden exclamation of dismay.  The
Inspector and Joe were coming in through the window,
carrying between them the limp, unconscious body of
Sergeant Bentley.
</p>

<p>
Marsden glanced round, his usually stolid face
flushed and contorted.
</p>

<p>
"They've shot him, doctor&mdash;shot him down like a
dog and got away in the car.  They must have had
it standing ready in the garage."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, he and Joe lowered their burden gently
on to the thick rug which lay just across the window,
and the next instant Colin had dropped on his knees,
and was bending forward over the prostrate figure.
</p>

<p>
To an untrained eye the spectacle was a ghastly
one, for the man's face was covered with blood, which
had trickled down from a broad gash in his forehead.
His pulse was still beating, however, and after feeling
it for a few moments, and then closely examining the
injury, Colin looked up with a little gesture of relief.
</p>

<p>
"It's not as bad as it appears," he announced.
"The bullet must have struck him sideways and glanced
off the outside of his temple.  He's only stunned."
</p>

<p>
"Only stunned!" repeated the Inspector.  "Well,
in that case he can stop here with Bates and Miss
Seymour, while you and I go after the others.  If
they once get on board that boat we may have the
devil's work in catching them."
</p>

<p>
Colin started up immediately, but before he could
speak he was interrupted by Nancy, who had followed
him into the room.
</p>

<p>
"I can tell you where the yacht's lying," she said.
"I heard them talking about it.  It's in some small
creek just this side of Thames Haven."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector wheeled round sharply on Colin.
"Do you know the way?" he demanded.  "Do you
think you can overtake them?"
</p>

<p>
"I expect I can," replied Colin, "unless Nancy
would rather I stayed with her."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head decisively.  "I shall be all right
with Joe," she said.  "I want to see those two men
punished for trying to kill you."
</p>

<p>
"You'd want it still more if you knew what we do,
miss," said the Inspector drily.
</p>

<p>
He rummaged in the sergeant's pocket, and, pulling
out a pair of light steel handcuffs, snapped them
round the wrists of the still unconscious Hudson.
</p>

<p>
Colin turned to Nancy.  "You might bathe this
poor fellow's wound, and bandage him up with a clean
handkerchief.  If he comes round before we get back,
make him lie perfectly still on the sofa."
</p>

<p>
She nodded quietly, and with an approving grunt
the Inspector offered her his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, miss," he said.  "You're a fine young
lady, and I couldn't be more pleased to see you safe,
not if you were my own daughter."  Then, as if half
embarrassed by this outburst, he added brusquely.
"Come along, doctor!  They've got a good start
already, and we're only wasting time talking here."
</p>

<p>
He strode toward the window, and, just pausing
to press a kiss on Nancy's fingers, Colin followed him
out into the garden.
</p>

<p>
They made their way rapidly across the lawn and
down to the front gate.  The moon, which was almost
at its full, had already risen, its silver beauty lighting
up the roadway as plainly as though it were daytime.
</p>

<p>
The Inspector glanced up into the sky with some
gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be able to see where we're going, at all
events," he observed.  "How far do you think the
river is from here?"
</p>

<p>
"It must be about ten miles to Thames Haven,"
was Colin's answer.  "There's no other place they
could have left the yacht&mdash;not this side of Canvey
Island."
</p>

<p>
"Ten miles!" echoed the other.  "Well, if Fenton
knows anything about driving it's going to be a pretty
close business."
</p>

<p>
Breaking into a run, they hurried along the road to
where they had left the car, and with a sharp jerk of
the handle Colin set the engine in motion.  Followed
by the Inspector, he scrambled into his seat, and a few
seconds later he had backed hastily along the oak
paling, and swung round into the side turning which ran
southward across the marshes.
</p>

<p>
It was not a route that any one who was fond of his
life would have selected deliberately for the purposes
of fast driving.  Narrow and winding, with a thick
coating of mud plastered over its surface, it presented
such obvious dangers that even the most foolhardy
of motorists would have been forced to recognize the
advisability of caution.
</p>

<p>
Caution, however, was the particular virtue which
Colin felt least able to afford.  Unless he could make
up his lost ground on the more difficult stages of the
journey he could certainly abandon all hope of success,
for on an open and moonlit road Fenton's progress
would probably be as fast as his own.
</p>

<p>
With a full appreciation of the chances that he was
taking he therefore let out the car to a pace which
in any other circumstances he would never have
attempted.  Bumping over patches of loose stone, and
splashing through pools of water, he held resolutely
on, regardless of risk, while all the time immediately
ahead of him two broad and recently imprinted tire
marks stretched away encouragingly through the mud.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the Inspector's private emotions may have
been, it must be admitted that he faced the ordeal with
masterly restraint.  Once or twice, as they skidded
violently round a blind corner, he caught hold of the
side door with a spasmodic grip, but except for this
instinctive movement he maintained an expressionless
calm which certainly did credit to the self-discipline of
the Yard.
</p>

<p>
For the first three miles Colin needed all his skill
and luck to avoid disaster; then, as they drew farther
out into the lonely marshland which borders the north
bank of the Thames, the conditions gradually
improved.  The east wind, which blows perpetually over
that desolate region, had already begun to dry up the
surface of the road, while with nothing but an
occasional cowshed or a few leafless trees to obstruct the
view, the chances of running headlong into some
unforeseen death trap were reduced to much more
comforting proportions.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, with an abrupt movement, the Inspector
pointed ahead, to where a broad shaft of yellow light
streamed out against the sky.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" he demanded, putting his lips close
to Colin's ear.
</p>

<p>
"Mucking Lighthouse," was the answer.  "There
are some powder works away to the right, and the
creek they're making for is just between the two."
</p>

<p>
At a furious pace the car leaped forward along the
deserted road, the telltale track of the fugitives still
standing out plainly in the glare of the head lamps.
Colin was much too occupied with the wheel to indulge
in any further attempt at conversation, while sheltering
his eyes from the wind with one hand, and grasping
the back of the seat with the other, the Inspector
stared out in front of him in grim silence.
</p>

<p>
Rounding a slight curve between two low banks,
they emerged into a long stretch of almost perfectly
straight roadway, and at the same moment a simultaneous
shout burst from both their lips.  There in
the moonlight, not more than half a mile away, they
could see the dark outline and gleaming tail lamp of
another car, travelling swiftly in the same direction
as themselves.
</p>

<p>
"There they are!" roared the Inspector.  "Keep
her going, doctor!  Keep her going, and we've got 'em!"
</p>

<p>
With an inward prayer that his tires would stand
the strain, Colin drove down the accelerator to its
extreme limit.  The well-tuned engine responded to
his call, and with the wind rushing in their faces, and
the whole chassis quivering and rocking beneath them,
they surged on recklessly in pursuit of their escaping
quarry.
</p>

<p>
Any doubt as to the respective pace of the two cars
was settled in the next minute.  Slowly but surely
the distance between them lessened, until in the bright
moonlight it was possible to make out the bare head
and broad shoulders of "Spike" Cooper as he crouched
in the seat alongside the driver, staring back over the
swaying tonneau.
</p>

<p>
"Look out for that devil!" shouted the Inspector.
"He'll start shooting directly we're close enough."
</p>

<p>
Clutching his own pistol in his hand, he leaned
forward over the dashboard, his eyes glued on the
motionless figure ahead.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer they drew, the mud and gravel
flying from beneath their wheels, the roar and throb
of the engine seeming to beat time to the mad rhythm
of the chase.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, with a warning cry, Marsden raised his
weapon.  There was a simultaneous spurt of flame
from both cars, and with a vicious thud something
buried itself in the padded seat just beside Colin's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Crack!  Crack!  Crack!
</p>

<p>
A second bullet ripped its way along the front mud
guard, and then, with a kind of stupefying and
unimaginable abruptness, the end came.
</p>

<p>
Colin was just conscious of a shower of sparks from
beneath the steel-studded tires as the car in front of
him swerved violently across the road.
</p>

<p>
By some instinctive movement his hand shot out
toward the brake lever, and almost at the same second
came a deafening and appalling crash that seemed to
strike him in the face like a blow from a fist.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWELVE
</h3>

<p>
"That's done it," remarked the Inspector bitterly.
</p>

<p>
He was standing in the car which Colin had just
pulled up, staring down over a heap of stones at the
black mass of broken wreckage which reared itself
fantastically amongst the grass.
</p>

<p>
"I should think it was about the finish," said Colin
quietly.  "What on earth made them skid in that
extraordinary way?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I hit Fenton by mistake," said the
Inspector.  "Just like my cursed luck.  He must have
driven straight into it and gone clean over the top.
It's a hundred to one they're both dead."
</p>

<p>
"We'll soon find out, anyhow," was Colin's answer,
and, opening the door as he spoke, he jumped down
into the roadway.
</p>

<p>
A few strides brought him alongside the fallen car,
where, in the pitiless moonlight, every detail of the
tragedy stood out with horrible distinctness.  Almost
the first sight that met his eyes was the bodies of
Fenton and Cooper, the former pinned down under
the débris amid a cloud of escaping steam, and the
other sprawled full length on the bare ground.
</p>

<p>
It was very obvious that nothing could be done for
Fenton.  The top of his skull had been smashed in
like an eggshell, and, after just pausing to glance at
the injury, Colin hurried over toward the prostrate
figure of his companion.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian was lying on his face, his arms and
legs flung out at a grotesque angle.  To any one with
medical knowledge there was something fatally suggestive
about the mere attitude of the limbs, and it was
no little surprise to Colin that, as he stooped down to
make a closer examination, a low groan reached his
ears.
</p>

<p>
With great care he turned over the helpless man
and raised him in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've got one of 'em alive, anyhow," observed
the Inspector, who had followed him across the
grass.
</p>

<p>
As though conscious of the remark, Cooper opened
his eyes, and for a moment lay there with his head on
Colin's shoulder, gazing up vaguely into the two faces
above him.  Then something that was almost a grin
flickered across his face.
</p>

<p>
"I guess we've met before, mister," he jerked out
faintly.  "Say, how the hell did your friends get you
out of that cellar?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind now," interrupted the detective curtly.
"You've got something else to think about at present.
I am Inspector Marsden of Scotland Yard, and I arrest
you for the murder of Professor Carter."
</p>

<p>
There was a glint of mockery in Cooper's face as
his eyes travelled slowly in the direction of the
speaker.
</p>

<p>
"Good for you, Sherlock Holmes," he gasped.  "I
reckon the British police ain't quite such duds after
all."  He paused, as though the effort of speaking had
been almost too much for him.  "It's tough luck you
won't get the credit of hanging me," he added, in an
even feebler voice.  "Still, if you will be so damn
careless with that gun o' yours&mdash;&mdash;"  He stopped,
and with a little choking cough spat out a mouthful of
blood.
</p>

<p>
The Inspector turned anxiously to Colin.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with him?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"His spine's practically broken," said Colin.  "He
can't live more than a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
Marsden bent over the dying man, on whose white
face the moonlight streamed down with a peculiarly
ghastly effect.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, Cooper," he said.  "We know all
about you.  We've got your record from Montreal.
Fenton's dead, and I don't imagine that our friend
Medwin is a particular pal of yours.  Come, man,
you may just as well tell us the truth."
</p>

<p>
Cooper, who seemed to be breathing with extreme
difficulty, moistened his lips.
</p>

<p>
"It's no good, mister," he faltered.  "You can't
put a rope round Medwin's neck&mdash;not this journey.
He hadn't no more to do with croaking the old guy
than you or the doctor."
</p>

<p>
Marsden nodded.  "I know that," he said.  "You
broke into the house the second time by yourself in
order to try and rob the safe.  Neither Fenton nor
Medwin knew anything about it&mdash;until afterward."
</p>

<p>
Cooper looked up at him again, the same
half-jeering smile on his drawn face.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to be with Pinkerton," he gasped.
"You're just wasted here."
</p>

<p>
As he dragged out the last word another paroxysm
of coughing overtook him.  It lasted for several
seconds, and then, with a queer, fluttering movement of
the eyelids, his head suddenly lolled over sideways on
to his shoulder, the under jaw dropping open at the
same time.
</p>

<p>
Colin lowered his burden to the ground, and after
wiping his hands on the grass, rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the Inspector stood still, gazing down
at the body.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's done the hangman out of a job," he
observed regretfully.  "What's more, I believe the
devil was right.  We shall only be able to charge
Medwin with conspiracy, though if any man ever
deserved&mdash;&mdash;  Hullo!  here's somebody coming!"
</p>

<p>
He broke off abruptly at the sight of a dark figure,
which was approaching along the roadway from the
direction in which they had been travelling.
</p>

<p>
"One of the men from the powder works, I expect,"
said Colin.  "We're quite close by, and they probably
heard the crash."
</p>

<p>
Marsden stepped forward to meet the new arrival,
who had turned on to the grass and was hurrying
rapidly toward them.  As he drew nearer they saw
that he was a respectable-looking middle-aged man,
dressed in a rough suit of tweeds.
</p>

<p>
He came on at a kind of stumbling run, and pulled
up with an exclamation of horror as the full extent
of the disaster suddenly met his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" he exclaimed.  "I was afraid there
had been a bad accident.  Is anybody killed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Marsden bluntly.  "Both these men
are dead."  He paused.  "Who are you, sir, and
where do you come from?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"My name's Trevor.  I'm the head electrician at
the powder mills just down the road."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm a police officer," said Marsden, "and
this gentleman is Doctor Gray."
</p>

<p>
"A police officer?" repeated the other.  "Is there
anything&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One of our friends here," continued Marsden,
jerking his head in the direction of Cooper's body,
"is the murderer of Professor Carter.  I have no
doubt you read about the case in the papers.  The
other was wanted on an almost equally serious charge."
</p>

<p>
Their new acquaintance stood staring at them in
open-mouthed amazement.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but what on earth were they doing down
here?" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"They were trying to reach Thames Haven, where
they hoped to get on board a boat.  We were following
them in another car, and just as they got to this
point they swerved right across the road into that heap
of stones.  You can see the result for yourself."
</p>

<p>
The electrician nodded his head.  "Yes," he
replied, "I can.  You must excuse my being a bit
flabbergasted, but it's pretty quiet round about here
as a rule, and this kind of thing's a trifle out of my
line."  He removed the soft hat that he was wearing
and wiped his forehead with his coat sleeve.  "What
do you propose to do?" he asked.  "We've a telephone
at the works if you'd like me to get into
communication with any one."
</p>

<p>
Marsden pulled out his pocketbook and extracted
a card.
</p>

<p>
"This is my name," he said.  "Do you mind going
straight back and ringing up the Southend Police
Station?  Say that you're speaking for me, and ask
them to send out a motor ambulance and a car as
soon as possible.  They'll know the powder works,
and when they arrive perhaps you'll be good enough
to bring them on here."
</p>

<p>
"Why, certainly," was the answer.  "In the
meanwhile, if there's anything you want that I can let
you have&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know if you could run to a whisky
and soda," suggested Marsden hopefully.  "I could
do with a drink after what we've been through the
last quarter of an hour."
</p>

<p>
"I'll send one of the men along with it," responded
the other, and without waiting to be thanked he nodded
a hasty farewell, and set off at once in the direction
of the roadway.
</p>

<p>
Marsden turned to Colin.  "You can get back to
'The Firs' and pick up Miss Seymour if you like.
There's no point in your remaining here, unless you
want to stop until the whisky comes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang the whisky!" said Colin.  "It's you I'm
thinking of.  I can't leave you stranded in a ditch
with a couple of corpses."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't worry about that," returned Marsden
cheerfully.  "I've been in worse company, and, in any
case, the Southend police will be turning up in round
about half an hour.  No, you go along, doctor, and
take Miss Seymour home in the car."
</p>

<p>
"What about the sergeant and Joe?" inquired Colin.
</p>

<p>
"They can wait for us.  We shall be passing the
house on our way back, and if Bentley's still
unconscious there'll be room for him in the ambulance."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it seems rather a shame to desert you," said
Colin.  "All the same, if you really don't mind I
think I will push off.  Nancy must be pretty well
tired out, and the sooner I can get her back to
Shadwell the better."
</p>

<p>
"She'll be all right," said Marsden encouragingly.
"If you think she needs a little tonic give her my
congratulations and tell her that she's worth a couple
of hundred thousand pounds."  He held out his hand.
"You shall hear from me later in the evening.  I'll
either 'phone you up or come down to Shadwell
myself."
</p>

<p>
"Come if you possibly can," said Colin.  "Nancy
will be longing to thank you for everything you've
done, and if you want any further inducement Mark's
got some topping good champagne."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The light was still streaming out through the
shattered window as, leaving his car at the gate of
"The Firs," Colin once more made his way up the
drive and strode eagerly across the lawn.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the verandah he found that the broken
hasp had been fastened roughly together inside by a
piece of wire, and while he was endeavouring to
disentangle the latter the figure of Joe appeared suddenly
in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
At the sight of Colin he hastened forward with a
shout of welcome.
</p>

<p>
"'Alf a moment, guv'nor.  'Ere, let me get at it.
You'll cut your 'and on that glass if you ain't careful."
</p>

<p>
With a quick turn of his fingers he wrenched off
the wire and flung open the window, and at the same
moment Nancy herself came hurrying into the
room.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Colin, at last!" she cried.  "I was so afraid
that something had happened to you."
</p>

<p>
Regardless of Joe, Colin took her into his arms
and kissed her two or three times with reassuring
fervour.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing has happened to me, Nancy," he said.
"I'm afraid I can't say the same with regard to Fenton
and Cooper."
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him with a startled expression in
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Colin!" she exclaimed.  "You don't mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His arms tightened round her.  "I had to let you
know," he said gently, "though I hate to spring any
more horrors on you.  I'm not sure it isn't all for the
best.  Cooper would certainly have been hanged, and
as for Fenton&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wot's 'appened, gov'nor?" broke in Joe anxiously.
"You ain't goin' to tell me they're both dead?"
</p>

<p>
"They were when I left them," said Colin.  "As
dead as any one I've ever seen in my life.  They ran
into a heap of loose stones just this side of Thames
Haven and smashed themselves to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if that ain't the limit!" observed Joe
disgustedly.  "'Ere' ave I bin waitin' to bash 'ell outer
that bloke Cooper&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop, Joe!" commanded Nancy almost angrily.  "I
won't have you talking like that.  It's wicked."
</p>

<p>
The abashed boxer fell back, and with a quick
breath she turned again to Colin.
</p>

<p>
"Where's the Inspector?" she asked.  "Why hasn't
he come with you?"
</p>

<p>
"He's all right," said Colin.  "We got someone
to send a message through to the Southend police, and
he's waiting for them to turn up with a motor
ambulance.  He suggested that in the meanwhile I
should come on here and take you home in the car.
He's going to call for Joe and the sergeant on his
way back."  He paused and glanced inquiringly round
the room.  "By the way," he added, "where is the
sergeant, and what's happened to my pal Jake Hudson?"
</p>

<p>
"Hudson's locked up in the cellar," replied Nancy.
"We carried the other poor man into the hall and put
him on the sofa.  I bandaged up his head as well as
I could, but he's still unconscious."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go in and have a look at him," said Colin.
"Then I should think we might as well push off.  I've
all sorts of exciting news for you, Nancy."
</p>

<p>
"If you mean about Mr. Carter being my grandfather,"
she interrupted calmly, "I know that already."
</p>

<p>
Colin stared at her in amazement.  "You know it
already?" he repeated.
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head.  "Yes," she said, "Joe told
me.  Of course, there's a lot I don't understand yet,
but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to do it, guv'nor," protested Joe;
"strike me dead if I did.  She jest started askin'
questions, and afore I knew wot 'ad 'appened, damn me if
I 'adn't given away the 'ole show."
</p>

<p>
Colin looked from one to the other of them, and
then began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I could depend on you, Joe," he said
reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
The boxer glanced at Nancy with a kind of admiring
resentment.  "I always reckoned I could keep my
mouth shut," he muttered, "but she's one o' them
young laidies a bloke ain't got no chance with."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know if that's a compliment or not," said
Nancy.  "Anyhow, Colin, do come along and see what
you think of my patient.  We shall have plenty of
time to talk about me when we're going home in the
car."
</p>

<p>
She led the way out into the hall, and, crossing to
where the unconscious and heavily breathing Bentley
lay propped upon the sofa amongst a pile of cushions,
Colin bent down to inspect the bandages which
encircled his head.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing the matter with this," he said
approvingly.  "You must have been having lessons from
Mark in your spare time."  He made a brief examination
of the man's pulse and general condition, while
the others stood by watching him in silence.  "I don't
think there'll be much to worry about when he comes
round," he added, "but of course he'll have to keep
to his bed for a day or two."  He turned to Joe.
"Put some of these cushions round him so that he
isn't shaken about in the ambulance, and tell Marsden
to take him to the hospital directly you reach London."
</p>

<p>
"I believe there must be some kind of curse on me,"
said Nancy rather ruefully.  "I seem to bring trouble
on everyone I have anything to do with."
</p>

<p>
"You ain't no call to feel like that, miss," objected
Joe.  "A cracked 'ead ain't much in the way of
trouble&mdash;not for a policeman, any'ow."
</p>

<p>
"You can be pretty sure that that's the way in
which Bentley will look at it," said Colin.  "As for
the Inspector"&mdash;his gray eyes lit up with a boyish
twinkle&mdash;"well, if he hadn't told me that he was a
married man with three children I should have been
jolly careful not to ask him round to Shadwell this
evening."
</p>

<p>
With a little laugh Nancy held out her hands
toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Take me home, Colin," she said.  "I feel like
Charles Lamb when they gave him a pension.  I want
to go home for ever."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Mark filled up his empty glass, and, settling himself
in his armchair, beamed paternally at Colin and
Nancy, who were sitting opposite to him on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"It only shows how careful one ought to be," he
said.  "Just think of the chance I missed when I took
Nancy on as a secretary!  If I'd had any idea that
she was going to blossom out suddenly as a sort of
female Rothschild I should immediately have adopted
her as my daughter."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it's as well you didn't," said Colin,
laughing.  "She'd have found it a bit of a strain to
carry out the fifth commandment."
</p>

<p>
Nancy, who was looking distractingly pretty as she
lay back against the cushions, smiled contentedly at
them both.
</p>

<p>
"I think it's much better as it is," she said.  "If
I hadn't known what it felt like to be bullied and
ordered about I shouldn't be half so happy when I'm
married to Colin."
</p>

<p>
Mark set down his glass with an air of pretended
dismay.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear child," he exclaimed, "you can't
possibly marry Colin now.  You must put that idea
right out of your head.  Why, with your looks and
two hundred thousand pounds you might make an
alliance with a duke."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, yes!" observed Colin blankly.  "I never
thought of that."
</p>

<p>
He turned to Nancy, but before he could add anything
further she raised her finger in a peremptory
warning.
</p>

<p>
"It's no use, Colin dear," she said.  "Joe saw you
hugging and kissing me at 'The Firs,' and I'm not the
sort of girl to allow my young affections to be trifled
with.  If you attempt to back out of it now I shall
sue you for breach of promise."
</p>

<p>
The distant tinkle of a bell sounded through the
house, and, raising himself in his chair, Mark glanced
indignantly at the clock.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang it all!" he exclaimed.  "I'm not going
to see any more patients to-night.  It's nearly ten,
and, besides that, I'm beautifully and comfortably
intoxicated."
</p>

<p>
"It may be Marsden," suggested Colin.  "He
promised to come down if he could manage to spare
the time."
</p>

<p>
They heard the front door open and close, and after
a brief interval the somewhat breathless figure of
Martha Jane burst unceremoniously into the room.
</p>

<p>
"There's a police inspector downstairs," she
announced.  "'E says 'e's come to see Doctor Gray."
</p>

<p>
Mark hoisted himself to his feet.  "Show him up,"
he said hospitably, "and then fetch along another glass.
If any one else calls, tell them that I've been sent for
to Buckingham Palace to operate on the King."
</p>

<p>
Leaving the door open behind her, Martha Jane
vanished down the staircase.  There was a murmur
of voices, followed by a creak of footsteps, and a
moment later she reappeared, with the bullet head and
broad shoulders of the detective mounting in her wake.
</p>

<p>
Jumping up from the sofa, Colin met him as he
entered the room.
</p>

<p>
"So glad you've been able to come, Marsden," he
exclaimed.  "We only wanted you to complete the
party."  He waved an introductory hand in the
direction of Mark.  "This is my friend, Doctor Ashton.  I
don't think there's any need to introduce you to Miss
Seymour!"
</p>

<p>
Marsden smiled, and, stepping forward, shook hands
with his host.
</p>

<p>
"Pleased to meet you, doctor," he said.  "I'm
sorry to disturb you at this hour, but, as you've
probably heard, we've been having rather a busy and
exciting afternoon."  He turned to Nancy.  "I hope you're
not feeling much the worse for it, miss?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," said Nancy, "thanks to you and Colin.
I only wish I could tell you how grateful I am for all
you've done for me."
</p>

<p>
Marsden shook his head.  "It's very good of you
to say so, miss, but I'm not throwing any bouquets at
myself this journey.  On the contrary, I don't think
I've ever made so many blunders in a case in the whole
of my professional career."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what are you worrying about?" demanded
Colin.  "Except for the regrettable fact that we can't
hang Cooper&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You haven't heard my news yet," interrupted
Marsden.  "I'm almost ashamed to confess it, but the
fact remains that we've allowed Medwin to slip
through our fingers."
</p>

<p>
Colin stared at him incredulously.  "Medwin
escaped!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"If you like to put it that way.  He has escaped
being sent for trial, anyhow.  At the present moment
he's lying in the mortuary at the Kensington Police
Station."
</p>

<p>
With a faint cry of horror Nancy caught hold of
Colin's hand.
</p>

<p>
"It was all my fault," continued Marsden.  "I
ought to have made certain of him before we left
London.  It never occurred to me he'd play us a
dirty trick like this."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" broke in Colin.  "When I
left him he was tied up on the sofa.  How on
earth&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, the servants came back and untied him,"
said Marsden curtly.  "He invented some cock-and-bull
story about having been attacked by a couple of
burglars, and then sent them down to the kitchen and
locked himself in his study.  As soon as I got back
to London I telephoned through to Kensington and
gave instructions for his arrest, but by that time it
was too late.  They found him sitting dead in his
chair, with a letter which he had just written lying on
the table beside him.  He had swallowed enough
poison to kill half a dozen people."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief silence.
</p>

<p>
"I see now," said Colin slowly.  "He told me he
knew when he was beaten, and that's evidently what
he meant."  He paused.  "And the letter?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Marsden put his hand in his pocket and produced
a large square envelope.
</p>

<p>
"The letter was my chief reason for coming down
here.  As a matter of fact, it was addressed to you,
but under the circumstances I've taken the liberty of
opening it."
</p>

<p>
He presented the envelope to Colin, who, after
glancing unbelievingly at his own name, pulled out
and unfolded its contents.

"My dear Gray,&mdash;You will probably be surprised
at receiving a letter from me, but you must
put it down to the whim of a dying man.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"The truth is, I feel that I owe an apology both
to you and to Miss Seymour.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I will make no attempt to defend my conduct.
I frankly admit that it justifies practically every
one of the uncomplimentary epithets which you
hurled at me in the course of your dramatic visit.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"The only accusation against which I must enter
a protest is that either Fenton or I was in any way
concerned with the murder of my old friend and
client, the late Professor Carter.  On this point
you are entirely mistaken.  It was the work of that
senseless ruffian Cooper, whom we had employed to
assist us in breaking into the Red Lodge when we
found it necessary to examine the Professor's papers.
I sincerely hope that this information will be of
some assistance in bringing him to the gallows.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"On the charges of embezzlement and conspiracy,
however, the fact remains that I have rendered
myself liable to a considerable term of penal servitude.
It is an unpleasant position, but one which I am
perfectly prepared to face.  Playing for high stakes
has always had a peculiar attraction for me, and in
the event of failure I have never been one of those
poor-spirited sportsmen who object to settling their
accounts.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I doubt if you will believe me, but I should like
to say in conclusion that as far as you are concerned
I have no feeling of resentment.  On the contrary,
if you had not been so infernally in my way it would
have been a distinct pleasure to me to cultivate your
society.  Being of a somewhat complex temperament,
I derive considerable enjoyment from the
companionship of a crude and vigorous young
savage like yourself.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I do not know whether you arrived in time to
rescue Miss Seymour from the embraces of our
mutual friend, but I have no doubt that you will
succeed in consoling her for any unpleasant
experiences to which she may have been subjected.
From the little I saw of her she struck me as being
a singularly attractive and high-spirited young lady.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Please convey to her my apologies for the
unchivalrous treatment she has received, and also
express my regret that there should be a shortage of
some twenty thousand pounds in the money to
which she is entitled.  As the sum which still
remains, however, amounts to about a hundred and
seventy thousand pounds, it will be amply sufficient
to provide you both with those minor comforts and
luxuries which form such an agreeable addition even
to the happiest of married lives.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Colin read through this remarkable communication
in silence, and, having come to the end, handed it to
Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"It's just the sort of letter I should have expected
him to write," he observed.  "The only thing I'm
surprised at is that he didn't send us a wedding present."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's queer your putting it like that," replied
the detective.  "As a matter of fact, it's the very
same remark which I made to the Commissioner.
There's a certain type of criminal who doesn't care
what happens to him as long as he can die showing
off and codding himself that he's a sportsman and a
gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that's true," said Nancy, looking up
from the letter.  "I do wish he hadn't killed himself,
though.  I hate to feel that three people have lost
their lives and all on account of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's only because you're not accustomed to it,"
interrupted Mark comfortingly.  "When one's been
a doctor for twenty years a trifling massacre like this
leaves one quite unperturbed."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke Martha Jane appeared with the clean
glass, and, taking it off the tray, he turned to
Marsden.
</p>

<p>
"How about a drop of champagne, Inspector?"
he suggested.  "There's nothing like it after a busy
day, and, besides, you've got to drink to the health of
the happy pair."
</p>

<p>
"I won't say no to a good offer like that," returned
the detective.
</p>

<p>
He accepted the beaker which Mark held out to
him, and, raising it in his hand, nodded first to Nancy
and then to Colin.
</p>

<p>
"I've already congratulated the doctor," he said.
"As for you, miss, if you'll excuse my saying so, I
think you've made as big a success in choosing a
husband as you did in choosing a grandfather."
</p>

<p>
He drained his glass to the dregs, and set it down
on the table with an appreciative smack.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to tear myself away from such a
pleasant party," he added, "but I've got to get back
to the Yard and complete my report of the case.
We're fixing the inquest for the day after to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I have to give evidence?" inquired Nancy
in some dismay.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid there's no getting out of that, miss.
You and Doctor Gray will be the two principal
witnesses, but I shall be seeing the Coroner first, and you
can take it from me that you won't be asked more
questions than are absolutely necessary."  He turned to
Colin.  "I should like to see you the first thing in
the morning, doctor.  This case is bound to attract a
good deal of attention, and there are one or two
points in connection with it which it will be better if
we keep to ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Colin calmly.  "You tell
me what you want us to say, and Nancy and I will stick
to it like Britons."
</p>

<p>
Marsden laughed, and, picking up his cap from the
table, shook hands all round.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see you as far as the door, Inspector,"
suggested Mark.  "I think I'm just sober enough to
be able to manage the staircase."
</p>

<p>
He led the way out on the landing, followed
by the detective, and for the first time since their
return to the house Colin and Nancy found themselves
alone.
</p>

<p>
He put his arm round her, and, bending down,
kissed her hair.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't let all this distress you too much,
darling," he said gently.  "It's been a horrible and
ghastly business, but I do believe it's ended in the best
way possible.  If these men hadn't been killed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know, Colin," she said.  "I think it's only a
sort of selfish feeling I've got.  I am so happy myself
I want everyone else to be happy too."
</p>

<p>
"So they are!" declared Colin.  "At least, everyone
who matters.  There's you and I and Mark and
Mary and Joe&mdash;&mdash;"  He paused.  "By the way, I
wonder what's happened to Joe."
</p>

<p>
"I know what's going to happen to him," said
Nancy.  "Directly I get my money I'm going to buy
him the biggest and most beautiful public house in
Shadwell.  If it wasn't for Joe&mdash;&mdash;"  Her voice
faltered, and with a sudden impulsive movement she
caught hold of Colin's hand and pressed it to her
cheek.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he stood looking down at her, his
gray eyes alight with love and tenderness.
</p>

<p>
"There's only one thing that isn't quite perfect," he
said slowly.  "I'm afraid that, whatever success I
meet with in my research work, I'm bound to be more
or less disappointed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Colin, what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," he whispered softly, "I've already made the
greatest discovery in the world.  <i>I've found you</i>."

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
